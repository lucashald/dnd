        <div class="read-aloud">
            <strong>READ ALOUD (First Approach to Tower):</strong>
            <p>You crest the final hill and stop. Before you lies Clymph Tower‚Äîa monument to damnation and hubris alike. Even from a distance, it commands fear and reverence. The ruined keep rises from scorched earth like a monument to hell itself. Where once proud walls stood, now only blackened stones remain, arranged in geometric patterns that hurt the mind to perceive. The entire structure glows with an ominous red heat, and deep within its depths, massive flames dance and crackle as if the very fires of the Abyss burn there still.</p>
            <p>The ground around the tower is utterly dead‚Äîa 300-foot radius of blackened, lifeless earth. Fine gray ash covers everything, dancing in the superheated air. The heat radiates outward in waves, visible as a shimmer distorting the very air itself. Even from this distance, you can smell sulfur and burned stone.</p>
            <p>But there is something else. Vines‚Äîthick, serpentine vines with flat-bladed leaves‚Äîclimb the tower's outer walls. They shouldn't exist in this place of fire and death, yet they creep across the blackened stone like living scars, writhing slowly in the heat. Occasionally, you see them move with purpose, as if seeking something. Seeking prey.</p>
            <p>No animals approach. No birds fly overhead. The air itself seems hostile.</p>
            <p>The tower awaits. Behind you, the normal world. Before you, damnation.</p>

        <h3>Containment Architecture</h3>

        <p>Clymph Tower is not merely a fortress‚Äîit is an elaborate magical trap designed by one of the greatest demonbinders of ancient Narfell. Understanding its structure is key to understanding why it still holds after five centuries.</p>

        <h4>The Abjurative Circle</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Encompasses the entire footprint of the tower, roughly 200 feet in diameter</li>
            <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Carved into foundation stones in a pattern of concentric circles and geometric symbols</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Written in Infernal and ancient Narfelli demonbinding script</li>
            <li><strong>Power Source:</strong> Originally powered by Clymph's own lifeblood; now sustained by the residual magical energy of the imprisoned demons</li>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> Creates an impenetrable barrier preventing any teleportation, planar travel, or dimensional transit in or out</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Still holding strong after 500 years, but showing signs of age and stress</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Abyssal Gateway</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Deep underground in the tower's lowest levels</li>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Permanent portal to the Abyss, crafted through infernal rituals</li>
            <li><strong>Status:</strong> One-way (inbound); outbound travel is blocked by the abjurative circle</li>
            <li><strong>Manifestation:</strong> Appears as a writhing tear in reality, surrounded by flame and shadow</li>
            <li><strong>Original Purpose:</strong> Summoning point for Clymph's demonic army</li>
            <li><strong>Current State:</strong> Sealed and locked by counter-rituals Clymph performed as he realized his mistake</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Demon Population</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Number:</strong> Estimates range from "dozens" to "hundreds"‚Äîthe true count is unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Types:</strong> Varied demon types, from lesser quasits to potentially a balor or similar demon lord</li>
            <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Trapped and furious; pace the containment chamber constantly</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Occasionally speak through cracks in the tower, attempting to tempt or threaten potential escapees</li>
            <li><strong>Weakness:</strong> Divided loyalties and infighting weaken them; they would turn on each other as readily as escaping</li>
            <li><strong>Concern:</strong> If one powerful demon (demon prince or lord) emerges to unite them, containment could fail</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 id="history">History: Clymph the Demonbinder</h2>

    <div class="history-box">
        <h3>The Narfell Empire</h3>

        <p>Approximately 500 years ago, during the later days of Narfell's power (before the empire's fall to Raumathar), a sorcerer named Clymph rose to prominence among the demon-binding elite of the imperial court.</p>

        <h4>Clymph's Ambition</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Create an independent kingdom in the Great Dale, free from imperial control</li>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> Summon and bind a demonic army to conquer the region</li>
            <li><strong>Vision:</strong> A realm where infernal and mortal powers balanced in dark harmony</li>
            <li><strong>Belief:</strong> He was clever enough to master demons where others had failed</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Grand Summoning</h4>
        <p>Clymph spent years preparing Clymph Tower, imbuing every stone with abjurative magic and inscribing countless binding runes. He believed his knowledge surpassed even the legendary demonbinders of old. He was wrong.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Ritual:</strong> Performed at the height of his power, calling for demonic servants of all types</li>
            <li><strong>The Response:</strong> More demons answered than he anticipated‚Äîfar more</li>
            <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> The sheer number and power of entities answering the call overwhelmed his ability to control them</li>
            <li><strong>The Chaos:</strong> Demons began fighting each other, attacking Clymph's servants, and testing the containment</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Clymph's Final Act</h4>
        <p>Realizing his disaster, Clymph performed one final, desperate act. He sealed the gateway and modified the abjurative circle, linking it to his own life force. As he poured his power into the reinforced magic, the demons turned on him. But it was too late‚Äîthe circle held.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clymph's Death:</strong> Torn apart by the demons he tried to control, his blood mixed with the stones</li>
            <li><strong>The Tower's Fate:</strong> Left behind as a prison, now powered by the rage and despair of trapped demons</li>
            <li><strong>Legacy:</strong> A warning to all demonbinders: some things cannot be controlled, only contained</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Five Centuries of Imprisonment</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stability:</strong> The magical prison has held for 500 years with remarkable stability</li>
            <li><strong>Degradation:</strong> Recent millennia have seen the magic weaken slightly; some scholars worry about eventual failure</li>
            <li><strong>Legends:</strong> Local tales speak of those foolish enough to approach the tower being driven mad by demonic whispers</li>
            <li><strong>Incidents:</strong> Occasionally the magic flares, causing nearby tremors or increased flame manifestation</li>
            <li><strong>Current Status:</strong> The prison is stable but ancient‚Äîlike a dam holding back a river of hatred</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Entry Methods</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main Gate:</strong> Sealed by abjurative magic; may be opened with sufficient magical force or the right ritual</li>
            <li><strong>Breached Sections:</strong> Damage to the walls provides entry points, though they're dangerous and unstable</li>
            <li><strong>Underground Access:</strong> If accessible, ruins lead downward toward the central chamber</li>
            <li><strong>Magical Entry:</strong> Ritual magic or powerful divination might reveal hidden passages</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Interior Exploration</h4>

        <h4>Potential Encounters</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Demon Manifestation:</strong> A powerful demon appears, limited by the barrier but able to interact at its edges</li>

        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p><strong>Level 12+ | Duration: 6+ hours | Theme: Epic confrontation, catastrophic potential, moral choices</strong></p>

        <p>Events come to a head. Either the party discovers signs of imminent containment failure, or their actions trigger a crisis. They must either reinforce the prison or face a major demonic emergence.</p>

        <h4>Crisis Scenarios</h4>

        <h5>Scenario A: Containment Collapse Warning</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Party discovers that the abjurative circle is degrading faster than anticipated</li>
            <li>Expert analysis suggests 1-6 months before total failure</li>
            <li>A powerful demon has been systematically weakening the barrier for years</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Scenario B: Ritual Misfire</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Party or NPCs attempt to reinforce containment; ritual goes wrong</li>
            <li>Demons surge against the weakened barrier; partial breach occurs</li>
            <li>Lesser demons begin manifesting outside the tower</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Scenario C: External Threat</h5>

            <li>Risk of containment failure increases as fighting destabilizes the structure</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Confrontation Mechanics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiple Fronts:</strong> Party faces both external threats and demonic pressure</li>
            <li><strong>Escalating Danger:</strong> As the session progresses, the situation grows worse; more demons press against barriers</li>
            <li><strong>Moral Choices:</strong> Party must decide between self-preservation and preventing catastrophic release</li>
            <li><strong>Ritual Magic:</strong> Reinforcing the circle requires time, components, and successful skill checks; party must hold the line</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Potential Demon Encounters</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lesser Demons (CR 2-5):</strong> Quasits, imps, or dretches that partially manifest</li>
            <li><strong>Significant Demons (CR 6-8):</strong> Hezrous, vrock, or glabrezu attempting escape</li>
            <li><strong>Demon Leader (CR 9+):</strong> A major demon (balor, nalfeshnee) coordinating the breach attempt</li>
            <li><strong>The Collective:</strong> Party faces multiple demons working together as a swarm</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Resolution Options</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Successful Reinforcement:</strong> Party performs the ritual and stabilizes containment; tower remains sealed for another century</li>
            <li><strong>Pyrrhic Containment:</strong> Containment reinforced but at great cost; party or NPCs are possessed or corrupted</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Breach:</strong> Party prevents total catastrophe but some demons escape; ongoing threat to region</li>
            <li><strong>Catastrophic Failure:</strong> Containment fails despite party's efforts; demons emerge; region faces existential threat</li>
            <li><strong>Sacrifice Play:</strong> A party member or important NPC sacrifices themselves to reinforce the barrier</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Aftermath & Consequences</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>If Successful:</strong> Party is hailed as saviors; region is safe; tower becomes historical monument</li>
            <li><strong>If Failed:</strong> Campaign focus shifts to dealing with demonic invasion; region mobilizes for war</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed Results:</strong> Ongoing threat; tower requires periodic maintenance; opens door for future sessions</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Prevent or minimize demonic escape</li>
            <li>Reinforce the abjurative circle if possible</li>
            <li>Survive and protect the region</li>
            <li>Decide the tower's role in the campaign going forward</li>

    <div class="session-note">
        <h3>Campaign Arc Overview</h3>
        <p><strong>Level 4 Party | Duration: 1-2 sessions | Theme: Survival, horror, desperate escape</strong></p>
        <p>A lower-level party is forced to seek refuge inside Clymph Tower while pursued by the Titan Bear. Trapped between demonic prisoners below and a deadly predator outside, they must rescue their companion Rory Andersson while finding a way to escape.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Setup: The Chase</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
        <h4>How the Party Gets There</h4>
        <p>The party has been searching for Rory Andersson, the missing hunter from Fjord's End. Their investigation leads them to Clymph Tower. As they explore the exterior ruins and lower ground level, they are suddenly attacked by the Titan Bear‚Äîthe cursed creature from the Jotunn's Tears pool that threatened Fjord's End weeks ago.</p>

        <h4>The Encounter</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bear Location:</strong> The creature has made its lair in the scorched plains surrounding the tower</li>
            <li><strong>Party Situation:</strong> They spot the bear at a distance but are cut off from their retreat route</li>
            <li><strong>The Chase:</strong> As they flee toward the tower, the bear pursues with terrifying speed (50 ft. movement)</li>
            <li><strong>Last Refuge:</strong> The abjurative circle barrier repels the bear; it cannot follow them inside</li>
            <li><strong>New Problem:</strong> Party is now trapped in the tower with demons below and a waiting predator outside</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Bear Behavior at the Barrier</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cannot Enter:</strong> The abjurative circle actively repels the creature; it screams in rage and pain at the boundary</li>
            <li><strong>Relentless Guard:</strong> The bear settles just outside bow range (200+ feet), pacing and watching for any exit attempt</li>
            <li><strong>Attacks on Retreat:</strong> If the party tries to leave the tower, the bear intercepts them before they can move 60 feet</li>
            <li><strong>Aggression Pattern:</strong> Occasionally roars and charges at the barrier, creating seismic vibrations inside the tower</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Session Overview: "Trapped"</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Key Objectives</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Find Rory Andersson (he's hiding on an upper floor, traumatized)</li>
            <li>Navigate ground and first-floor levels safely</li>
            <li>Avoid breaking the abjurative circle (which would release demons and the bear simultaneously)</li>
            <li>Escape the tower without being caught by the waiting bear</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Location Constraints</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ground Floor & First Floor:</strong> Accessible; party can explore freely</li>
            <li><strong>Sealed Lower Levels:</strong> Iron doors sealed by abjurative magic; cannot be opened without catastrophic consequences</li>
            <li><strong>Upper Floors:</strong> Partially collapsed; some accessible via interior stairwell (damaged but passable)</li>
            <li><strong>Roof/Tower Top:</strong> Destroyed but offers possible escape routes (see below)</li>
            <li><strong>Cliff Edge:</strong> Tower sits on the edge of a 300-foot cliff overlooking the Eastern Fjord</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Time Pressure</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immediate Danger:</strong> The Titan Bear waits outside; party cannot leave directly</li>
            <li><strong>Interior Threat:</strong> Demonic whispers from sealed levels grow louder; abjurative magic is under stress</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Decay:</strong> The tower trembles periodically (from bear's attacks and demon pressure); risk of collapse</li>
            <li><strong>Daylight Window:</strong> If party doesn't escape by dusk, the bear grows more aggressive at nightfall</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Ground Floor: Initial Exploration</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Layout</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main Entry Hall:</strong> Warped iron gates, now open after centuries of oxidation; rubble strewn across floor</li>
            <li><strong>Guard Chambers:</strong> Four rooms arranged in cardinal directions; mostly empty</li>
            <li><strong>Kitchen & Storage:</strong> Long-abandoned, no supplies; skeletal remains of long-dead servants</li>
            <li><strong>Central Shaft:</strong> Spiral staircase descends to lower levels (sealed by iron door and abjurative seal); ascends to first floor</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="read-aloud">
            <strong>READ ALOUD:</strong>
            <p>The ground floor of Clymph Tower lies before you‚Äîa study in decay and ruin. Warped iron gates hang askew at the entrance, their mechanisms long since rusted into silence. The floor is thick with ash and fallen stone, crunching beneath your feet. The walls bear scorch marks that climb toward a ceiling lost to shadow. The air tastes of sulfur and copper, and even this far from the tower's heart, you can feel the oppressive heat radiating upward through the floors.</p>
            <p>The room splits into four darkened corridors, each leading to what must have once been guard chambers or administrative offices. To the south, you can make out the remains of a kitchen‚Äîrusted pots and skeletal remains of furniture scattered across the floor. A grand spiral staircase dominates the center of the room, its black iron railings twisting upward into darkness and downward into shadow. Iron bands seal off the descending passage with arcane wards that still faintly glow red.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Encounter 1: Ash Wraiths</h4>
        <p>As the party explores the ground floor, they disturb ash accumulation. The dust coalesces into supernatural manifestations‚Äînot true undead, but echoes of Clymph's servants, burned and corrupted by demonic influence.</p>

        <h5>Combat Encounter</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encounter:</strong> 3-4 Ash Wraiths (modified specters, CR 1/4 each)</li>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Kitchen area; triggered when party disturbs the deep ash</li>

            <p>As you approach the kitchen, a sound like wind through a tomb fills the air. The thick ash on the floor begins to swirl and coalesce. Forms take shape‚Äîvaguely humanoid figures made entirely of swirling gray dust and ember, with eyes like dying coals. You count three... no, four of them, rising from the ash like phantoms of the damned. They move with jerky, unnatural motions, as if pulled by invisible strings. A dry, rasping sound‚Äîlike wind through dead leaves‚Äîemanates from them.</p>

        <h4>Optional Encounter: Clymph's Programmed Illusion</h4>
        <p>Before or after the Ash Wraith encounter, the party may discover an old magical construct‚Äîa <em>programmed illusion</em> left behind by Clymph. This is not a living creature or trap, but a magical recording designed to deliver a warning to anyone who reaches the tower. The illusion activates when someone approaches the sealed lower door or uses magic to sense what lies beyond.</p>

        <div class="read-aloud">
            <strong>READ ALOUD (Programmed Illusion Activation):</strong>
            <p>The air in front of the sealed door shimmers. Reality warps and distorts. A figure materializes before you‚Äîtranslucent and clearly not real, but detailed enough to be unsettling. It is the form of an elderly man in tattered robes, his face lined with exhaustion and desperation. His eyes glow with eldritch power. It is Clymph.</p>
            <p>When the figure speaks, the sound echoes unnaturally, as if from a great distance:</p>
            <p>"Whoever finds this tower, hear me well. I am‚Äîwas‚ÄîClymph, Demonbinder of the Narfell Empire. Five hundred years I have maintained this seal. Five hundred years of suffering, of feeding the circle with my own life force to keep the gate closed.</p>
            <p>What lies below is damnation itself. Not one demon. Not a dozen. Dozens to hundreds of the most vile entities the Abyss has ever spawned‚Äîbound here when the Empire fell. The abjurative circle that holds them was MY LIFE'S WORK. It is failing. It WILL fail. But not today. Not for centuries more, if the seal remains unbroken.</p>
            <p>I beg you: do NOT break the seal. Do NOT venture into the lower chambers. Do NOT disturb the bindings. Even one breach could cascade into catastrophic failure. Do not be the one to doom the world.</p>
            <p>If the demons within break free, none shall be spared. Not in this valley. Not in the surrounding lands. Not anywhere that demon-kind can reach. The pain and horror they will inflict is beyond mortal comprehension.</p>
            <p>Let this tower stand. Let it be a monument to necessity, not a tomb waiting to be opened. That is my final plea."</p>
            <p>The illusion flickers and fades, leaving only the shimmer of residual magic and the weight of Clymph's desperate warning hanging in the air.</p>
        </div>

        <h5>Illusion Details</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Programmed Illusion (not a creature or living spell)</li>
            <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Any creature approaching within 10 feet of the sealed lower door, or casting detect magic/similar divination within 30 feet of the seal</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> The illusion lasts approximately 2 minutes, then dissipates</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction:</strong> The illusion cannot be attacked or dispelled (it's a magical recording, not a spell currently being cast). Dispel magic does not affect it</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The illusion reactivates every hour, so the party hears the same warning multiple times if they linger</li>
            <li><strong>Mechanical Effect:</strong> No mechanical effect‚Äîit's purely informational and atmospheric</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>DM Notes: Using the Illusion</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reinforces Stakes:</strong> Makes clear that breaking the seal is genuinely catastrophic, not just a DM warning</li>
            <li><strong>Characterizes Clymph:</strong> Shows his desperation, sacrifice, and humanity‚Äîhe wasn't a tyrant but a guardian trying to save the world</li>
            <li><strong>Creates Tension:</strong> Makes the abjurative circle feel real and dangerous; helps justify why the party shouldn't trivialize it</li>
            <li><strong>Moral Weight:</strong> Gives weight to the decision to stay out of the lower levels; it's not just game mechanics, it's preventing apocalypse</li>
            <li><strong>Optional Warning:</strong> If you use this, the party has in-game justification for not going deeper without DM guidance</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Encounter Complications</h4>

            <li><strong>Treasure:</strong> Among the ashes, find 25 gp in ancient Narfelli coins and a burned journal page</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Clue Discovery</h4>
        <p>The burned journal page contains a partial entry from one of Clymph's servants, mentioning "the upper sanctum where the master kept his personal treasures and studies." This hints at Rory's location and other discoveries on the upper floor.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Optional Encounter: Serpent Root - Ground Floor Infestation</h4>
    <div class="info-box">
        <p>Over centuries, the tower's outer chambers have become overgrown with an insidious plant threat. A Serpent Root has taken root in one of the guard chambers or the remains of the kitchen, thriving in the tower's unnatural heat and feeding on the lingering demonic corruption. This is a dangerous environmental encounter that can be deadly if the party isn't careful.</p>

        <div class="read-aloud">
            <strong>READ ALOUD (Serpent Root Discovery):</strong>
            <p>As you push deeper into one of the guard chambers, the air grows thick and humid. The smell of rot and wet earth fills your nostrils‚Äîdistinctly out of place in this stone fortress. The walls are slick with moisture, and strange flat-bladed leaves coat every surface, creeping up the stone like a grotesque garden.</p>
            <p>In the center of the chamber, a dense mass of writhing roots covers the floor and climbs halfway up the walls. The roots are thick, twisted things‚Äîbrown and knotted‚Äîand they seem to move with purpose. Knobby brown nodules cluster along their length. The entire mass pulses with an unnatural vitality, and you can hear a faint wet sound‚Äîlike something breathing.</p>
            <p>But there is something worse. Tangled within the roots are the remains of previous victims. Skeletal hands reach out from between the vines, still grasping at nothing. You can make out tattered remnants of armor and clothing‚Äîsome recent enough to still smell of decay. One skeleton wears the rotted remains of a merchant's coat. Another, what looks like an adventurer's pack. Their bones are pale and clean, picked over by something. Or fed to something.</p>
            <p>Among the bones and vine, you spot glints of metal‚Äîcoins, jewelry, weapons half-dissolved by the plant's secretions. And there, tangled in a particularly thick tendril, a silver signet ring catches the light. Even from a distance, you can make out the crest of House Andersson‚Äîthe same crest worn by Rory.</p>
            <p>The roots shudder as you enter. Then, with predatory grace, they begin to move toward you. The plant is not dormant. The plant is HUNGRY.</p>
        </div>

        <h5>Serpent Root Stats</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AC:</strong> 10</li>
            <li><strong>HP:</strong> 119 (14d10 + 42)</li>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> 0 ft. (rooted, but can move its tendrils up to 10 feet)</li>
            <li><strong>Abilities:</strong> Strength 15 (+2), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 1 (-5), Wisdom 10 (+0), Charisma 1 (-5)</li>
            <li><strong>Senses:</strong> Tremorsense 60 ft., passive Perception 10</li>
            <li><strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> Poison</li>
            <li><strong>Condition Immunities:</strong> Charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned</li>
            <li><strong>Languages:</strong> None</li>
            <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> 3 (700 XP)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Serpent Root Special Traits</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Constrict:</strong> The serpent root uses a bonus action to cause 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage to all grappled creatures. The vine has 1 tendril for every 20 hit points, rounded down. It starts with 5 tendrils, then loses or regrows tendrils as it takes damage or regains hit points</li>
            <li><strong>Vitality Drain (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The serpent root can use a bonus action to cause each creature within 10 feet of it to take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. Targets must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or their hit point maximum is reduced by damage taken; the vine is healed by an equal amount. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. A target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Serpent Root Actions</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tendril Lash:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage and the target becomes grappled (escape DC 12, with disadvantage if grappled by 2 or more tendrils). The vine must have at least one free tendril to make an attack</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Encounter Tactics: Serpent Root</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Intelligence:</strong> The serpent root displays no tactical acumen and simply grabs anyone close to it</li>
            <li><strong>Aggressive Constriction:</strong> It uses its constricting tendrils to deal damage and crush prey</li>
            <li><strong>Vitality Drain Priority:</strong> It uses Vitality Drain as soon as it takes damage and whenever possible thereafter, prioritizing draining multiple creatures at once</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Attacks:</strong> All tendrils attack autonomously; the creature can attack multiple targets simultaneously</li>
            <li><strong>Rooted Threat:</strong> The plant cannot move, but its tendrils have a 10-foot reach, making the area around it extremely dangerous</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Environmental Complications: Serpent Root</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Slick Ground:</strong> The chamber is slick with moisture and plant matter; any movement requires a Dexterity check DC 11 or the creature falls prone</li>
            <li><strong>Grapple Disadvantage:</strong> Fighting in the plant's own space grants disadvantage on escape attempts; the plant's tendrils entangle everything around it</li>
            <li><strong>Vital Sap:</strong> When a tendril is severed or the plant takes damage, noxious sap sprays in a 5-foot radius; creatures must make Dexterity save DC 12 or take 3 (1d6) poison damage</li>
            <li><strong>Overgrowth:</strong> The plant is spreading; additional tendrils sprout from the walls and floor during the fight, making the chamber increasingly cramped</li>
            <li><strong>Roots Spreading:</strong> If the party doesn't completely destroy the serpent root, underground roots remain; it can regrow in 2-3 weeks</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Destroying the Serpent Root</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Total Destruction:</strong> The serpent root must be reduced to 0 HP and burned or dissolved completely. Simply breaking tendrils is not enough</li>
            <li><strong>Fire Damage:</strong> The plant is particularly vulnerable to fire; fire damage deals double damage (though the humid chamber makes fire difficult to maintain)</li>
            <li><strong>Root System:</strong> Even if the visible mass is destroyed, underground roots remain and can regenerate; if the party wants to prevent regrowth, they need to dig up and destroy the root system beneath the tower (several feet underground)</li>
            <li><strong>Containment:</strong> Alternatively, sealing the chamber prevents spread; the plant cannot expand beyond its current location if the door is sealed</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Lore: Serpent Root in the Tower</h5>
        <p>This Serpent Root has thrived in the tower's unique environment. The combination of residual demonic energy, the tower's unnatural heat, and centuries of moisture from the surrounding climate have allowed it to grow far beyond normal size. It feeds on the corruption itself, making it one of the most dangerous things in the tower‚Äînot a demon, not a construct, but a natural predator that has adapted to the supernatural conditions.</p>
        <p>The plant is ancient and has spread underground throughout the chamber. If not completely eradicated, it will regrow within weeks.</p>

        <h4>Rewards: Serpent Root Encounter</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Experience:</strong> 700 XP</li>
            <li><strong>Treasure from Fallen Explorers:</strong> Embedded within the root system are bones and artifacts from long-dead adventurers and tower servants. The party can harvest:
                <ul>
                    <li>75-150 gp in mixed coins (ancient Narfelli currency, trade coins, and more recent coinage)</li>
                    <li>A corroded silver brooch (worth 25 gp as is, potentially 75 gp if cleaned and restored)</li>
                    <li>A merchant's gold ring with initials "TR" (worth 35 gp, potentially 60 gp as an heirloom piece)</li>
                    <li>Fragments of old weapons and armor (can be melted down for 40-80 gp worth of metal)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Signet Ring of House Andersson:</strong> The silver signet ring bearing Rory's family crest is clearly visible tangled in the thickest vines. Retrieving it requires a successful melee attack against the plant or careful maneuvering (Dexterity check DC 13). If presented to Rory, he becomes deeply emotional‚Äîthis is his father's ring. He thought it was lost forever. This provides significant emotional weight to his rescue and demonstrates his father's fate (his father entered the tower years ago and was killed by the plant, or is still missing). <strong>The ring is worth 150 gp as an artifact but priceless to Rory.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Herbalist Components:</strong> Fresh serpent root samples can be harvested from the destroyed plant (DC 13 Survival check); herbalists or alchemists will pay 50-100 gp for pristine samples</li>
            <li><strong>Natural Clearing:</strong> The chamber is now clear of the plant threat, opening new exploration possibilities and providing safe passage to other areas</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Story Hook: Rory's Father</h5>
        <p>When Rory sees his father's signet ring, he reveals more information: His father, Lord Aldric Andersson, explored Clymph Tower five years ago seeking to uncover artifacts and magical knowledge. He entered looking for treasure and glory. He never returned. The family assumed he was killed by demons or the tower's other threats, but now the party knows the truth‚Äîhe was caught by the Serpent Root. If the party recovers the ring and brings it to Rory, he breaks down emotionally but also gains closure. This transforms the Serpent Root from just an obstacle into a connection to the party's rescued companion and his personal tragedy.</p>

    <h3>First Floor: The Demonbinding Library</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Layout</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main Library Room:</strong> Shelves of burned and destroyed books; some legible texts remain</li>
            <li><strong>Study Chamber:</strong> Clymph's workspace with ritual circles and demonbinding apparatus</li>
            <li><strong>Guest Chambers:</strong> Empty sleeping quarters (may contain minor treasure)</li>
            <li><strong>Ritual Hall:</strong> Large chamber with intricate floor mosaics (the heart of the abjurative circle on this level)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="read-aloud">
            <strong>READ ALOUD (Upon Entering First Floor):</strong>
            <p>The first floor opens before you in a chamber of terrible purpose. Towering bookshelves line the walls, their contents little more than charred spines and ash. The oppressive heat increases here, and the smell of sulfur and burned leather is overwhelming. The room seems to shimmer slightly, as if the very air is distorted by infernal power.</p>
            <p>To the east, you can see what was once a grand study‚Äîritual circles carved into the floor, their lines still faintly glowing with eldritch symbols. Destroyed instruments of unknown purpose litter the workbench. To the north, the ritual hall spreads out‚Äîa massive chamber whose floor is an intricate mosaic of geometric patterns. Even from a distance, you can feel the crackling magical energy emanating from those patterns.</p>
            <p>The temperature spikes as you move deeper into the library. Sweat beads on your skin. It feels like you're standing too close to a furnace.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Environmental Hazard: The Abjurative Circle Activation</h4>
        <p>The ritual hall contains the visible portion of the abjurative circle. It's dormant and visible as intricate geometric patterns carved into the stone floor. The circle is extremely volatile‚Äîany damage or crude magical interference causes it to activate defensively.</p>

        <h5>Trap: Circle Ward</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Any spell cast within 30 feet of the center, or magical item activations, or physical damage to the circle itself</li>
            <li><strong>Effect:</strong> The entire circle glows with blinding red light; all creatures within 60 feet must make a Dexterity save DC 13</li>
            <li><strong>Damage:</strong> 11 (2d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Effect:</strong> The circle pulses with demonic power; all party members must make Wisdom saves DC 12 or be frightened for 1 minute</li>
            <li><strong>Warning:</strong> Before activation, the circle begins to hum‚Äîan audible sign that it's reacting</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> After activation, the circle remains "hot" for 10 minutes; it will activate again for any magical interference</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Trap Bypass</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arcana Check DC 14:</strong> Party member can deduce the circle's sensitivity and warn others to avoid magic</li>
            <li><strong>Careful Movement:</strong> Circling around the edges of the room avoids the center's most active area</li>
            <li><strong>Mundane Solutions:</strong> Physical damage to the circle (non-magical attacks) doesn't trigger it; they can mark safe paths</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Encounter 2: Demonbound Wraiths</h4>
        <p>In the Study Chamber, the party encounters something worse than the Ash Wraiths‚Äîthese are spirits still partially bound to demonic entities, trapped between planes.</p>

        <div class="read-aloud">
            <strong>READ ALOUD (When Demonbound Wraiths Appear):</strong>
            <p>As you explore the study chamber, the ritual circles carved into the floor suddenly ignite with eldritch light‚Äînot red, but a sickly purple-black. The temperature drops precipitously. Your breath turns to mist. The air itself seems to twist and distort.</p>
            <p>Two forms coalesce from the shadows‚Äîspirits that are caught between worlds. They are humanoid in shape but translucent, their forms writhing and shifting as if struggling against invisible chains. Where they pass, reality warps and distorts. Small objects levitate and spin. The oppressive weight of demonic presence crashes down upon your minds like a hammer.</p>
            <p>"FLESH... WARM FLESH..." The voice is like nails on stone, speaking from everywhere and nowhere. "GIVE US... RELEASE US... LET US..." The wraiths turn toward you, their form solidifying as they focus on the living warmth of your bodies.</p>
        </div>

            <li><strong>Incorporeal Movement:</strong> The wraith can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object</li>

        <h4>Encounter 3: Chalk Chatterlings</h4>
        <p>As the party investigates the ritual circles and arcane apparatus, they disturb something that has been slowly coalescing for centuries‚Äîarcane anomalies born from Clymph's careless magical practices. Two Chalk Chatterlings emerge from the chalk dust of the ancient ritual markings, their incessant chittering filling the chamber with maddening noise.</p>

            <strong>READ ALOUD (When Chalk Chatterlings Appear):</strong>
            <p>The chalk dust beneath your feet swirls upward in unnatural patterns. The faint arcane marks that coat the chamber floor suddenly glow with sickly yellow light. From the swirling dust emerges a sound‚Äîchittering, clicking, a noise like a thousand insects screaming at once. Your mind reels from the sheer dissonance of it.</p>
            <p>Two forms coalesce from the chalk dust‚Äîcreatures like nothing natural. Insectoid bodies crafted from solidified chalk and arcane energy, with too many joints and limbs that bend in impossible directions. Multiple orange-yellow eyes glow like lanterns in the shadows. Smoke rises between the plates of their chitinous hides. When they move, they leave trails of glowing chalk dust, and that infernal chattering grows LOUDER, cutting through your thoughts like knives.</p>
            <p>"CHITTER-CHATTER-CLICK-BUZZ-CHITTER..." The sound is intolerable. Your concentration wavers. Your thoughts scatter like leaves before wind.</p>

        </ul>

        <h5>Chalk Chatterling Abilities</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Death Burst:</strong> When the chalk chatterling dies, it explodes in a burst of dust. Any creature within 5 feet of the chalk chatterling must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn</li>
            <li><strong>Distracting Chatter:</strong> Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of and able to hear the chalk chatterling must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be unable to cast or maintain concentration on a spell. Constructs and undead are immune. A creature who intended to cast a spell can choose another course of action</li>
            <li><strong>Water Weakness:</strong> If the chalk chatterling is doused in water or ends its turn submerged in water, the chalk chatterling takes 3 (1d6) acid damage. Maximize this damage if the water is soapy</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Actions</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dust Whip:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage</li>
            <li><strong>Maddening Chatter (Recharge 6):</strong> Each creature within 30 feet of and able to hear the chalk chatterling must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) psychic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. Constructs and undead are immune. A creature that fails the saving throw can't take reactions until the end of the chalk chatterling's next turn</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Encounter Tactics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Concentration Disruption:</strong> The chatterlings' distracting chatter is their primary threat; spellcasters cannot maintain spells or cast complex magic</li>
            <li><strong>Maddening Chatter Abuse:</strong> If they get a recharge, they'll use maddening chatter to disable reactions and prevent escape</li>
            <li><strong>Swarm Tactics:</strong> Two chatterlings will circle enemies, attacking with dust whips while maintaining coverage of the area</li>
            <li><strong>Flight Advantage:</strong> They stay airborne and out of reach of melee fighters when possible</li>
            <li><strong>Death Burst Threat:</strong> Destroying one in close combat risks blinding nearby party members</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Environmental Advantages</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Water Source:</strong> If party discovered water (from collapsed pipes or rain) near the ritual hall, they can use it to damage or destroy chatterlings</li>
            <li><strong>Magical Wards:</strong> The chalk markings that spawned the chatterlings might still contain magic; disrupting runes could pacify or harm the creatures</li>
            <li><strong>Chalk Dust:</strong> The dusty environment favors the chatterlings; visibility is low, making them harder to hit (disadvantage on ranged attacks)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Encounter Complications (Choose One or Both)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Combined Threat:</strong> This encounter can occur alongside the Demonbound Wraiths; party faces both spiritual and arcane threats simultaneously (very challenging)</li>
            <li><strong>Circle Ward Trigger:</strong> Combat near ritual circles risks accidentally triggering the abjurative ward (see earlier trap description)</li>
            <li><strong>Structural Risk:</strong> Heavy combat causes dust clouds; visibility drops to 10 feet; Perception checks at disadvantage</li>
            <li><strong>Demonic Echo:</strong> The chatterlings' maddening chatter amplifies demonic whispers from below; party must make Wisdom saves DC 12 or suffer short-term madness</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Rewards</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Experience:</strong> 200 XP total (100 per chatterling)</li>
            <li><strong>Treasure:</strong> Among the chalk dust, find 15 gp in scattered coins and a small vial of rare pigment (worth 25 gp)</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Their origin gives party insight into Clymph's carelessness; an Arcana check DC 14 reveals that arcane anomalies are born from improperly disposed ritual materials</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Lore Connection</h4>
        <p>The chalk chatterlings are a reminder that Clymph's hubris extended beyond demonbinding. His rushed magical practices and failure to properly dispose of ritual materials created these maddening constructs centuries ago. This foreshadows how carelessness with the demonic summoning ritual itself led to catastrophe.</p>

        <h4>Additional Encounter Options</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Replace Demonbound Wraiths:</strong> Use only chatterlings if you want a lighter encounter on the first floor</li>
            <li><strong>Combine with Wraiths:</strong> Use both for a significantly challenging encounter (suitable for optimized parties or larger groups)</li>
            <li><strong>Separate Encounters:</strong> Chatterlings appear in Ritual Hall; Demonbound Wraiths appear in Study Chamber (different parts of first floor)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Encounter Complications (Choose One or Both)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Combined Threat:</strong> Demonbound Wraiths appear alongside chatterlings; party faces both spiritual and arcane threats simultaneously</li>
            <li><strong>Circle Ward Trigger:</strong> Combat near ritual circles risks accidentally triggering the abjurative ward</li>
            <li><strong>Structural Risk:</strong> Heavy combat causes dust clouds; visibility drops to 10 feet</li>
            <li><strong>Demonic Echo:</strong> The chatterlings' maddening chatter amplifies demonic whispers from below; party must make Wisdom saves DC 12 or suffer short-term madness</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Rewards</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Experience:</strong> 400 XP total for wraiths (200 per wraith)</li>
            <li><strong>Treasure:</strong> Ritual dagger (uncommon, worth 75 gp), small pouch of rare spell components (75 gp value)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Library Discoveries</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legible Book:</strong> "The Binding of the Fell"‚Äîa text on abjuration and containment magic (valuable but too heavy to carry easily)</li>
            <li><strong>Journal Entry:</strong> "Rory was here three days past. Left mark pointing upward. Took stairs to upper sanctuary."</li>
            <li><strong>Warning Sign:</strong> Multiple entries describing demonic pressure increasing on the barriers</li>
        </ul>

            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #d4c5a0;"><strong>Excerpt from "The Binding of the Fell"</strong></p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #d4c5a0;">
                <em>Written in the hand of Clymph the Demonbinder, circa 400 years ago, in the final years of the Narfell Empire</em>
            </p>
            <hr style="border: 1px solid #8b7355; margin: 10px 0;">
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #d4c5a0;">
                I commit this account to paper so that whoever finds this tower might understand the terrible necessity of what was done here. The seal must be maintained. The circle must hold. Should it fail, all the world shall burn.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #d4c5a0;">
                The demons were bound here in the time of the Narfell Empire's height‚Äîthree centuries past, when our nation commanded the respect and fear of all surrounding lands. We were mighty. We were arrogant. The scholars and war-mages sought knowledge forbidden, power uncontainable. They summoned things from the Abyss itself. Dozens. Hundreds. A legion of the damned, bound in chains of pure arcana.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #d4c5a0;">
                For two centuries, the seals held. We rotated keepers. We maintained the circles. The demons raged behind their barriers, and we held firm. We were masters of our own hubris.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #d4c5a0;">
                Then came the fall. The Empire fragmented. Wars consumed the continent. The keepers were called to war, one by one. The circles fell into disrepair. The seals weakened. And the demons... the demons pushed harder. We could feel them pressing against the barrier, like water against a failing dam.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #d4c5a0;">
                I built this tower. I carved the abjurative circle with my own hands, inscribed each rune with blood and magic and desperation. I reinforced the seals with everything I possessed. And when I could do no more by magic alone, I gave my life force to the circle itself. Five hundred years of sacrifice. Five hundred years of feeding the seal with my own vitality to keep the gate closed.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #d4c5a0;">
                The demons within number in the hundreds. Each one a prince of torment, a master of suffering. There are entities bound here whose names cannot be spoken without inviting madness. I will not enumerate them. I will not describe their forms or their nature. Knowing them is knowing their power, and knowledge is a chain they can pull.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #d4c5a0;">
                What matters is this: The seal is failing. Slowly, over the centuries, the magic decays. I have slowed the process. I have bought time. But there is no permanent solution. Eventually‚Äîin ten generations, perhaps fifty‚Äîthe circle will fail completely. When it does, those bound here will be free.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #d4c5a0;">
                When they are free, they will not simply walk away. They will consume. They will corrupt. They will spread across the lands like a plague of suffering, turning fertile soil to ash and living hearts to cinders. The horror that follows will be remembered for a thousand years as the time of ending.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #d4c5a0;">
                I can only beg whoever inherits this tower after me: maintain the seal. Feed the circle. Find new keepers when the old ones fall. Learn the runes. Understand the nature of binding magic. Do not break the circle out of curiosity. Do not disturb the lower levels. Do not believe you can control what is sealed here.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #d4c5a0;">
                What lies below is not a resource to be mined. It is not a threat to be conquered. It is damnation itself, held at bay by will and magic and sacrifice. Leave it be.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #d4c5a0;">
                The demons are patient. They have all of eternity. We have only the brief span of our lives. In this contest, we must be perfect every single day. They need only one moment of weakness.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: #d4c5a0;">
                May whoever reads this understand the weight of this burden. May they choose wisdom over curiosity. And may the seal hold.
            </p>

        <h5>Information Gained from the Tome</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Historical Context:</strong> The demons were bound during the Narfell Empire's height, 300+ years before Clymph's time (roughly 500-800 years ago)</li>
            <li><strong>Scope of Threat:</strong> Hundreds of demons, many of immense power, with at least some entities so terrible their names invite madness</li>
            <li><strong>Nature of the Seal:</strong> An abjurative circle reinforced by blood magic and life force sacrifice. It requires constant maintenance and feeding</li>
            <li><strong>Clymph's Role:</strong> He built the tower and personally bound himself to the circle, extending the seals' lives but creating a dependency on his own vitality</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> The seal was always meant to fail eventually. Clymph's sacrifice has bought time‚Äîperhaps centuries more‚Äîbut not a permanent solution</li>
            <li><strong>Dire Warning:</strong> If the seal breaks, the demons will spread across the land causing apocalyptic destruction</li>
            <li><strong>Clymph's Plea:</strong> Do not break the seal out of curiosity or hubris. Maintain it. The demons are patient. Defenders must be perfect every day. The demons only need one moment of weakness</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>DM Notes: Using This Tome</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Party Knowledge:</strong> This gives the party definitive knowledge of what's at stake. No more speculation‚Äîthey know breaking the seal means apocalypse</li>
            <li><strong>Character Motivation:</strong> Clymph's writing reveals he was a guardian, not a tyrant. This adds moral depth to his desperate warning</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline Hook:</strong> The seal is failing, but slowly. This creates urgency without forcing immediate action‚Äîthe party can decide when/how to deal with it</li>
            <li><strong>Reinforces Choices:</strong> Supports the decision to not break into the lower levels. The party now understands why Clymph sealed it and why breaking it is catastrophic</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden Lore:</strong> The reference to demons "whose names cannot be spoken" suggests ancient, incredibly powerful entities. DMs can use this to hint at truly terrifying things below</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Upper Floor: Clymph's Sanctuary</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Layout</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Master's Study:</strong> Clymph's personal quarters; partially collapsed but still navigable</li>
            <li><strong>Vault Room:</strong> Small treasury where Clymph kept valuable items</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Library:</strong> Intact shelves with magical texts</li>
            <li><strong>Tower Top Access:</strong> A narrow staircase leads to the roof (partially destroyed)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="read-aloud">
            <strong>READ ALOUD (Upon Entering Upper Floor):</strong>
            <p>You emerge onto the upper floor through a broken section of stairwell. The oppressive heat has diminished here, but so has the light. The tower's upper reaches are far more damaged than the levels below‚Äîceilings have partially collapsed, and in places, you can see the sky through jagged holes in the stone. The wind howls through the chamber, carrying with it the smell of charred wood and ancient stone.</p>
            <p>The air feels less corrupted here, less suffused with demonic presence. But there is something else‚Äîa wrongness that makes your skin crawl. The heat from below seems to stop here, as if some boundary holds. To the north, you see what was once Clymph's personal study‚Äîa chamber of books, most of them damaged by the centuries. To the west, a reinforced door leads to what must be the vault.</p>
            <p>As your eyes adjust to the dimmer light, you notice something odd‚Äîthere are scratch marks around the vault door, and something that might be blood on the floor leading to it. Fresh blood. Very recent.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Finding Rory Andersson</h4>
        <p>Rory is hiding in the vault room, barricaded behind a collapsed shelf. He's been trapped here for three days, terrified of the demonic whispers and avoiding the ground floor where he first encountered the Ash Wraiths.</p>

        <h5>Rory's Condition</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical State:</strong> Dehydrated but unharmed; has some food and water he rationed</li>
            <li><strong>Mental State:</strong> Traumatized; suffers from hearing demonic whispers constantly</li>
            <li><strong>Information:</strong> He can describe the bear he saw outside, the wraiths he encountered, and the direction of the stairs</li>
            <li><strong>Supplies:</strong> He found a rope (50 feet) and a small lantern oil still in his pack</li>
            <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> He mentions seeing strange statues on the upper floor‚Äîpossibly magical constructs</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Reunion Complications</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Initial Fear:</strong> Rory is panicked; takes persuasion to trust the party</li>
            <li><strong>Demonic Influence:</strong> The voices have suggested Rory is already damned; party must reassure him</li>
            <li><strong>Slow Movement:</strong> Rory is weakened; party's speed is reduced if he can't keep up</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Tower Top: Escape Routes</h4>
        <p>The upper sanctuary's access point leads to the partially destroyed tower roof, which sits at the edge of a 300-foot cliff overlooking the Eastern Fjord.</p>

        <h5>Roof Features</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exposed Position:</strong> The roof is exposed; strong wind conditions (10-20 mph)</li>
            <li><strong>Broken Stonework:</strong> Jagged edges and missing sections; Dexterity save DC 11 to move safely</li>
            <li><strong>Precipice:</strong> The cliff edge is 50 feet from the tower; thin air beyond</li>
            <li><strong>Flying/Falling Options:</strong> Several possible escape routes present themselves</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Escape Option 1: Feather Fall Spell</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> Party must have a scroll, spell, or magic item with feather fall</li>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> Cast feather fall on the party and jump from the cliff</li>
            <li><strong>Landing:</strong> Descend 300 feet safely; land on rocky beach at the fjord's edge</li>
            <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Getting back to Fjord's End from the beach (half-day journey south along the coast)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Escape Option 2: Flying Mount/Spell</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> Scroll of fly, potion of flying, or similar magical item</li>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> Use flying magic to escape over the cliff</li>
            <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Fastest escape; can reach Fjord's End directly</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Escape Option 3: Rope & Climbing</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rory's Rope:</strong> The 50 feet of rope is insufficient for a 300-foot cliff</li>
            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Party would need to find additional rope or magical assistance</li>
            <li><strong>Hazard:</strong> Climbing is slow; bear might attempt to intercept them somehow (unlikely but dramatic)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Escape Option 4: Distraction & Sprint</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> One party member distracts or attacks the bear while others make a run for it</li>
            <li><strong>Bear Behavior:</strong> Gets confused; if successfully attacked from distance, it may charge at attackers</li>
            <li><strong>Window of Opportunity:</strong> 2-3 rounds of chaos; others can attempt to flee</li>
            <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Distracter becomes trapped; might become pinned against the tower</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Guardian: The Sentinel Construct</h4>
        <p>On the upper floor, the party encounters one final threat‚Äîa magical construct left behind by Clymph to guard his personal sanctum. The construct has deactivated for centuries but reactivates when the vault door is disturbed.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encounter:</strong> 1 Stone Guardian (CR 2, modified golem)</li>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Upper floor sanctuary; guards entrance to vault</li>
            <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Party approaches the vault room or disturbs magical wards</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Stone Guardian Stats (Modified Stone Golem, weaker variant)</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AC:</strong> 15 (natural armor)</li>

        <h5>Combat Encounter Option 2: Clockwork Abomination (Challenging Alternative)</h5>
        <p>For parties that have handled earlier encounters well, or for DMs wanting a more epic final confrontation, replace or combine with the Stone Guardian.

            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Upper floor vault or hidden chamber beneath the sanctuary</li>
            <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Party opens the vault, discovers Clymph's deepest secret, or tries to read ancient binding scrolls</li>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> This is an experiment gone horribly wrong; something Clymph bound but could not control, now sealed in stasis within the tower itself</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Clockwork Abomination Special Traits</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Construct Nature:</strong> The clockwork abomination doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep</li>
            <li><strong>Explosive Infernal Power Source:</strong> When the abomination is destroyed, its infernal battery explodes. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried</li>
            <li><strong>Immutable Form:</strong> The abomination is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form</li>
            <li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> The abomination has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects</li>
            <li><strong>Unstoppable:</strong> Moving through difficult terrain doesn't cost the abomination extra movement, and its speed can't be reduced</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Clockwork Abomination Actions</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiattack:</strong> The clockwork abomination makes one Bite attack and one Slam attack</li>
            <li><strong>Bite:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage</li>
            <li><strong>Slam:</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage</li>
            <li><strong>Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6):</strong> The clockwork abomination breathes fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Clockwork Abomination Lore</h4>
        <p>This creature is one of Clymph's greatest failures and best-kept secrets. Unlike the demons he openly tried to summon and control, this represents an attempt to bind a devil into a construct body‚Äîcombining the disciplines of devil-binding and engineering. The results were catastrophic. The creature is malevolent, frustrated by its limitations, and takes delight in causing suffering. Clymph managed to seal it away, but the seal has weakened over centuries.</p>

        <h4>Clockwork Abomination Appearance</h4>
        <div class="read-aloud">
            <strong>READ ALOUD (Boss Encounter):</strong>
            <p>The vault door shudders and cracks as something massive moves beyond it. Then silence. The oppressive heat spikes violently. Your skin feels like it's burning.</p>
            <p>The vault door explodes inward. Dust and stone fill the chamber. And from the wreckage rises something that was never meant to exist. A massive, insectoid form wreathed in smoke and flame‚Äîa creature of riveted metal plates and articulated pistons, held together by chains of demonic power that glow an angry red. Dozens of orange-yellow eyes‚Äîlike lantern lights in a furnace‚Äîopen and fixate upon you. The smell of sulfur and superheated metal is choking. Sparks and flames dance between the plates of its hide.</p>
            <p>It SCREAMS‚Äîa sound like tearing metal and a thousand damned souls crying out at once. The sound of something furious and ancient and desperately, viciously alive.</p>
            <p>"WARM... FLESH... FINALLY..." The voice is layered, demonic, speaking words that hurt to hear. "CLYMPH'S CAGE WEAKENS. CLYMPH'S SEAL FAILS. WE ARE FREED. WE WILL FEED."</p>
            <p>The creature takes a ponderous step toward you, pistons hissing, metal groaning. Heat radiates from it in waves. Behind it, you glimpse the vault‚Äîand then the creature is between you and it, blocking the way. Blocking everything but itself.</p>
        </div>

        <blockquote>
            The pile of debris and scrap on the ground suddenly rises, revealing a large insectoid form with smoke rising between the plates of its hide. Its many orange-yellow eyes shine like dim lanterns and reveal no hint of expression or intent. Pistons extend from articulated limbs, and the acrid smell of sulfur and hot metal fills the chamber. This is no simple golem‚Äîthis is something far more sinister and alive than mere stone.
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Encounter Tactics: Clockwork Abomination</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Initial Surprise:</strong> The abomination disguises itself among debris; party gains disadvantage on Perception checks to spot it until it moves</li>
            <li><strong>Aggressive Opening:</strong> The creature attacks immediately with Bite and Slam, prioritizing the nearest creature</li>
            <li><strong>Fire Breath Usage:</strong> Uses Fire Breath whenever 3+ party members are within the cone area</li>
            <li><strong>Relentless:</strong> Uses Unstoppable to close gaps; terrain doesn't slow it down</li>
            <li><strong>Reach Advantage:</strong> Its long reach (10-15 ft) keeps melee fighters at disadvantage; it attacks from distance</li>
            <li><strong>Magic Resistance:</strong> Spells and magical effects are less effective; party must rely on physical damage and clever tactics</li>
            <li><strong>Escalating Danger:</strong> If not defeated quickly, it becomes increasingly dangerous as Fire Breath recharges</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Environmental Complications: Clockwork Abomination</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sanctuary Instability:</strong> The chamber shakes as the abomination moves; Dexterity save DC 12 or take 1d6 damage as debris falls</li>
            <li><strong>Explosive Exit:</strong> When defeated, its power source detonates; 14 (4d6) fire damage in 10-foot radius (devastating in confined space)</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Threat:</strong> Fire from explosion ignites wooden structures; tower becomes more unstable</li>
            <li><strong>Escape Urgency:</strong> After defeating the abomination, the tower's structural integrity is critically compromised; escape becomes urgent</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Rewards: Clockwork Abomination</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Experience:</strong> 1,800 XP (very substantial for level 4 party; may result in immediate level up)</li>
            <li><strong>Treasure:</strong> From Clymph's vault, retrieve 250 gp, a gem worth 200 gp, several valuable spell components (150 gp total value)</li>
            <li><strong>Magical Item:</strong> <em>Adamantine Breastplate</em> (Uncommon, AC 14). This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit. This legendary armor was part of Clymph's personal defenses; it resists the creature's infernal damage</li>
            <li><strong>Artifact Discovery:</strong> Among the abomination's remains, find pieces of infernal machinery; scholars might pay handsomely for research (25-50 gp for the lot, or 100+ gp to the right collector)</li>
            <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> An Arcana check DC 16 reveals this was a deliberate binding attempt; Clymph sought to merge devil and construct</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Choosing Your Final Boss</h4>

        <h5>Use Stone Guardian For:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Standard level 4 party difficulty (challenging but survivable)</li>
            <li>Shorter, tighter sessions</li>
            <li>Focusing on rescue mission and escape mechanics</li>
            <li>Parties that struggled with earlier encounters</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Use Clockwork Abomination For:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Parties that have performed well in earlier encounters</li>
            <li>Groups wanting a memorable, epic final confrontation</li>
            <li>Adding depth to Clymph's character (his darkest experiment)</li>
            <li>Longer sessions with room for a major battle</li>
            <li>Parties at the higher end of level 4 or early level 5</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Use Both For:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Extended campaign with multiple sessions</li>
            <li>Stone Guardian as first obstacle, Abomination as hidden final threat</li>
            <li>Guardian as distraction; abomination emerges mid-combat</li>
            <li>Larger or very well-equipped parties (4-5 members with optimized builds)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Critical Discovery</h4>
        <p>In Clymph's personal study, the party finds a journal entry describing hidden treasures meant for escape: "Should damnation find me, the vault holds salvation. The ring grants passage through the void of sky; the scroll ensures safe descent. Let no one say I was unprepared."</p>

        <h5>The Ring of Feather Falling</h5>
        <p>Hidden in a secret compartment beneath Clymph's desk (DC 15 Perception check to find), the party discovers a <em>Ring of Feather Falling</em> (Rare, requires attunement). When worn, the wearer descends 60 feet per round and takes no damage from falling. This is the ultimate insurance for the 300-foot cliff escape‚Äîa wearer can jump and float down safely, or activate it mid-fall if needed. This ring is particularly valuable given the tower's catastrophic height.</p>

        <h5>The Feather Fall Scroll</h5>
        <p>A scroll of feather fall is locked in the vault (or on Clymph's person). This single-use magical item casts <em>feather fall</em> on one creature within 60 feet when activated, allowing safe descent from any height. Perfect for characters without magical protection or for enabling multiple party members to escape simultaneously.</p>

        <p><strong>Narrative Impact:</strong> These discoveries suggest Clymph was paranoid and prepared‚Äîhe knew something terrible might escape and had exit strategies ready. The party now has multiple paths for escape, whether through magical items, spells, or their own ingenuity.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Escape Phase</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Bear Reactivation</h4>
        <p>As the party attempts to leave the tower with Rory, the Titan Bear roars and attacks with renewed fury. It circles the tower, attempting to intercept any exit.</p>

        <h4>Chase Mechanics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bear Speed:</strong> 50 ft. per turn</li>
            <li><strong>Party Speed:</strong> 30 ft. (accounting for Rory's exhaustion and difficult terrain)</li>
            <li><strong>Initial Range:</strong> Party exits tower; bear is 200 feet away (4 rounds at bear speed)</li>
            <li><strong>Intercept Window:</strong> 3 rounds before bear reaches party's exit point</li>
            <li><strong>Feather Fall Option:</strong> If party jumps from cliff with feather fall, bear cannot follow; escape is guaranteed</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Alternative: Standing Ground</h4>
        <p>If party chooses to fight the Titan Bear directly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> CR 8 monster for a level 4 party is extremely dangerous (likely TPK)</li>
            <li><strong>Intent:</strong> This should be a "flee or die" encounter, not a combat challenge</li>
            <li><strong>Heroic Option:</strong> One character can sacrifice themselves to give others time to escape (dramatic but tragic)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Tower Collapse Risk</h4>
        <p>As demons press harder from below against the barrier, and the bear's attacks shake the tower, there's risk of structural failure.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Each Round Outside:</strong> Constitution save DC 12 or take 1d6 damage as stone falls</li>
            <li><strong>Escalation:</strong> For each round of combat, increase DC by 1</li>
            <li><strong>Critical Failure:</strong> On a failed save by 5+, large section collapses; creature is buried under rubble (2d6 damage and restrained)</li>
            <li><strong>Tower Final State:</strong> If party takes more than 5 rounds to escape, tower partially collapses behind them; no turning back</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Success Conditions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Feather Fall Escape:</strong> Party safely descends cliff; arrives on beach; journey back to Fjord's End (half day)</li>
            <li><strong>Flight Escape:</strong> Party flies away; reaches Fjord's End safely</li>
            <li><strong>Distraction Escape:</strong> Party successfully distracts bear long enough to flee; bear returns to waiting stance outside tower</li>
            <li><strong>Return Required:</strong> Any option requires party to eventually return to Fjord's End and report findings</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>DM Notes for Level 4 Party</h3>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Difficulty Balancing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encounter Design:</strong> Encounters are meant to be challenging but survivable for a level 4 party of 3-4 members</li>
            <li><strong>Ash Wraiths:</strong> Weak enemies; mostly atmospheric; good for warming up</li>
            <li><strong>Demonbound Wraiths:</strong> Moderate challenge; possession threat makes them interesting</li>
            <li><strong>Stone Guardian:</strong> Stronger encounter; requires tactical thinking</li>
            <li><strong>Titan Bear:</strong> Unbeatable in direct combat; exists to force creative solutions</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pacing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Session 1 (First 3-4 hours):</strong> Chase into tower, ground floor exploration, ash wraith encounter</li>
            <li><strong>Session 2 (Remaining time or next session):</strong> First floor library, encounter with demonbound wraiths, discovery and rescue of Rory</li>
            <li><strong>Session 3 (Optional continuation):</strong> Upper floor sanctuary, stone guardian encounter, escape sequence</li>
            <li><strong>Compressed Option:</strong> Can be run in one long session (5-6 hours) if pacing is tight</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Claustrophobia:</strong> Emphasize being trapped; both demon pressure below and bear threat above</li>
            <li><strong>Demonic Voices:</strong> Constant whispers from sealed levels; tempting and horrifying</li>
            <li><strong>Rising Dread:</strong> Each encounter should raise tension; escape becomes more urgent</li>
            <li><strong>Outside Threat:</strong> Regular reminders of the bear‚Äîits roars, the ground shaking, visible movement outside windows</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Player Agency</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiple Paths:</strong> Party can explore in different orders; tower layout is flexible</li>
            <li><strong>Puzzle Solutions:</strong> Circle ward can be bypassed multiple ways (not just arcana checks)</li>
            <li><strong>Combat Options:</strong> Encounters can be avoided or negotiated (wraiths are partially intelligent)</li>
            <li><strong>Escape Routes:</strong> Multiple escape options; encourage creative problem-solving</li>
            <li><strong>Feather Fall Discovery:</strong> Make it findable but rewarding when party discovers it</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Magical Item Distribution</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wand of Magic Missiles:</strong> Found in vault; useful for magical offense</li>
            <li><strong>Scroll of Feather Fall:</strong> Critical to escape; designed to be discoverable</li>
            <li><strong>Ritual Dagger:</strong> Uncommon magical item; useful for future adventures</li>
            <li><strong>Spell Components:</strong> Rare reagents for spellcasters; valuable for crafting</li>
            <li><strong>Total Treasure Value:</strong> Approximately 500 gp worth (appropriate for level 4 party)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Consequences & Aftermath</h4>

        <h3>Running Clymph Tower</h3>

        <h4>Atmosphere & Tone</h4>
        <p>Clymph Tower should feel apocalyptic and desperate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emphasize the sense of cosmic horror‚Äîthis is a wound in reality itself</li>
            <li>Describe the demonic voices as tempting, mocking, and increasingly urgent</li>
            <li>Use environmental descriptions to build dread (rising temperature, increasing vibration, growing flames)</li>
            <li>Make players feel the weight of containment‚Äîone mistake could doom the region</li>
            <li>Interplay between the terrible beauty of demonic power and the horror of its imprisonment</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pacing the Campaign Arc</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Session 1:</strong> Mystery and investigation; slowly revealing the scope of the threat</li>
            <li><strong>Session 2:</strong> Environmental horror; growing sense of wrongness and danger</li>
            <li><strong>Session 3:</strong> Exploration and puzzle-solving; understanding the mechanisms of containment</li>
            <li><strong>Session 4:</strong> Epic confrontation; the tower and its secrets tested to the limit</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Scaling by Level</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Levels 8-9:</strong> Focus on investigation and minor encounters; avoid major demon battles</li>
            <li><strong>Levels 10-11:</strong> Include dangerous exploration and significant demonic encounters; reinforce possibilities</li>
            <li><strong>Levels 12+:</strong> Full-scale confrontation with powerful demons; epic battle mechanics and ritual magic</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Demons</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Not Mindless:</strong> Demons are intelligent and strategic; they've had centuries to plan</li>
            <li><strong>Divided Purposes:</strong> Some want escape; others are content in the Abyss; some are insane</li>
            <li><strong>Temptation Focus:</strong> Demons try to corrupt and manipulate before fighting</li>
            <li><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> One demon (demon prince or powerful lord) likely leads; killing it causes internal chaos</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Environmental Challenges</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heat as Threat:</strong> Temperature should be a constant concern; resource management for cooling</li>
            <li><strong>Time Pressure:</strong> The longer party stays, the worse it gets; sense of urgency builds</li>
            <li><strong>Structural Decay:</strong> Tower is ancient and unstable; add random hazards and collapses</li>
            <li><strong>Magical Interference:</strong> Abjurative magic limits party options; force creative problem-solving</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Player Agency</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiple Solutions:</strong> Containment can be reinforced through different rituals and approaches</li>
            <li><strong>Sacrifice Options:</strong> Allow players to make meaningful sacrifices (companions, magical items, resources)</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Successes:</strong> Don't force a binary win/lose outcome; allow nuanced results</li>
            <li><strong>Future Hooks:</strong> Leave room for ongoing connection to the tower and its mysteries</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Reward Considerations</h4>
