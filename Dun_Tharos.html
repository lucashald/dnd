            <h2>Historical Overview</h2>
            <p>Dun-Tharos has stood for millennia as a symbol of power and dominion, though the forces that wield that power have changed dramatically throughout the ages.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Ancient History - Empire of Narfell</h2>
            <p>In ages past, Dun-Tharos served as the capital of the great and terrible <strong>Empire of Narfell</strong>, ruled by the Nentyarchs. The Narfell were a dark realm of proud, sinister lords who commanded mighty keeps and legions. At its height, the empire was a formidable power, feared and respected across the land.</p>

            <h3>The Demonic Age</h3>
            <p>The Narfell Empire became increasingly corrupted by demonic influence. Dark cults flourished within its walls, and the final rulers of the empire descended into madness and cruelty. Dun-Tharos became a stronghold of the demonpriests, where unspeakable rituals were performed and innocent blood was spilled in service to dark powers.</p>

            <h3>The Cataclysm</h3>
            <p>The empire's era ended in catastrophic warfare when the Empire of Narfell clashed with Raumathar in a conflict of apocalyptic proportions (approximately -946 DR). The final blow came when some mighty spell of unspeakable power was unleashed, utterly leveling the city and ending the Narfell empire forever. The fortress lay in ruins for centuries, slowly being consumed by the encroaching forests.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>The Druidic Era (543 DR - 1371 DR)</h2>
            <p>In 543 DR, the Great Druid of Leth took the title of Nentyarch and claimed Dun-Tharos for the druidic cause. Rather than rebuild the black keep of the ancient demonpriests, the druids wove new magic through the ruins, creating something altogether different: a castle of living trees, animated and shaped by powerful nature magic. This fortress served as a symbol of the Circle of Leth's dominion over the land and the Rawlinswood.</p>

            <h3>The Circle of Leth's Reign</h3>
            <p>For nearly 600 years, successive Nentyarchs ruled from this forest-castle at the heart of the Rawlinswood. The Circle used Dun-Tharos as their base of power, from which they defended the wilderness against encroaching civilization. The druidic castle represented the triumph of nature over the corrupted past—ancient evils buried beneath living wood and growing things.</p>

            <p>From this stronghold, the Circle maintained their opposition to settlements like <a href="Uthmere.html">Uthmere</a>, viewing civilization's expansion as a threat to the natural world. The druids were not always peaceful in their defense of the land, and Dun-Tharos became a place of both mystery and danger to outsiders.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Corruption - Present Day (1369 DR onwards)</h2>
            <p>Two years ago (1369 DR), a catastrophic event unfolded. The <strong>Rotting Man</strong>, a Chosen of Talona (the goddess of poison, decay, and disease), launched a devastating assault on Dun-Tharos. The Circle of Leth, caught unprepared or overwhelmed by the Rotting Man's power, was driven from the fortress and scattered.</p>

            <h3>The Rotting Man's Dominion</h3>
            <p>Dun-Tharos is now firmly under the control of the Rotting Man and his corrupted followers, the Blightlords. The castle of living trees has withered and died, its magic twisted and perverted by the Rotting Man's foul sorcery. The once-verdant keep, symbol of natural life and druidic magic, now serves as a seat of decay and corruption.</p>

            <h3>Current Threats</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Rotting Man:</strong> A powerful Chosen of Talona commanding dark and profane magic</li>
                <li><strong>The Blightlords:</strong> Corrupted servants of the Rotting Man, empowered by his dark patronage</li>
                <li><strong>Hundreds of Minions:</strong> Undead creatures, diseased servants, and twisted abominations lurk in the ruins, ready to surge forth and slay at the Rotting Man's command</li>
                <li><strong>Magical Corruption:</strong> The fortress itself has become a place of death and madness, warped by profane sorcery</li>
                <li><strong>Plague & Disease:</strong> The entire region surrounding Dun-Tharos has become tainted; sickness and blight spread from the fortress like a plague</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Forest's Fate</h3>
            <p>The Rawlinswood, once a place of natural beauty and druidic magic, now suffers under the corruption emanating from Dun-Tharos. The trees wither and blacken. Strange, twisted creatures emerge from the undergrowth. Travelers report a pervasive sense of wrongness—the wrongness of the natural order inverted and corrupted by disease.</p>

            <h2>Significance to the Campaign</h2>
            <p>Dun-Tharos represents multiple convergent threats to the region:</p>

            <h3>A Spreading Darkness</h3>
            <p>The corruption spreading from Dun-Tharos is not merely military or magical—it is a plague of disease and death that poisons the land itself. If unchecked, this corruption could spread beyond the Rawlinswood to threaten settlements throughout the region, including <a href="index.html">Fjord's End</a>.</p>

            <h3>The Fall of the Circle of Leth</h3>
            <p>The Circle of Leth, though often at odds with settlements over land use and expansion, was a known force in the region. Their defeat suggests a new, more sinister power is rising. The druids' dispersal may create instability in the wilderness, with unpredictable consequences.</p>

            <h3>Ancient Evil Reborn</h3>
            <p>Dun-Tharos has a history of serving dark masters—from the demon-cult that dominated the final Narfell empire to the current reign of the Rotting Man. The fortress itself seems cursed to attract and amplify evil. Understanding Dun-Tharos's past may provide clues to defeating its present master.</p>

            <h3>Potential Hooks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Refugees fleeing the corrupted Rawlinswood and Dun-Tharos's influence seek aid and shelter</li>
                <li>The Rotting Man's minions expand outward, threatening nearby settlements and trade routes</li>
                <li>Surviving druids of the Circle seek allies to reclaim their fortress</li>
                <li>Ancient Narfell artifacts or knowledge might provide insight into combating the corruption</li>
                <li>The party may be called upon to investigate, defend against, or even attempt to reclaim Dun-Tharos</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>DM Notes</h2>
            <p>Dun-Tharos serves as a major threat and campaign focal point, representing the rise of a new dark power in the region. The fortress is not meant to be approached lightly—it is a seat of power for a Chosen of Talona and should feel like a devastating threat requiring significant preparation to oppose.</p>

            <p>The corruption spreading from Dun-Tharos can serve as a ticking clock for the campaign, with the party racing to stop its expansion before it threatens their home settlements. Alternatively, allies defeated or corrupted at Dun-Tharos can provide emotional stakes and motivation for the party's eventual confrontation with the fortress and its master.</p>
