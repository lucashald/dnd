    <h2>Character Overview</h2>

    <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #e6f3ff; border-left: 4px solid #4682b4;">
        <h3>Divine Heritage</h3>
        <p>Ember walks a path few could imagine—a child of two worlds, bearing the blood of both celestial and mortal. His father is an angel, his mother a Tabaxi he has never known. Abandoned as a cub on a church doorstep alongside his sister Nightrose, Ember was raised in the loving care of Selûne's faithful. His patron, a Hollyphant of radiant wisdom, guides him on a quest to understand his scattered tribe and the truth of his mother's fate.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Background & History</h2>

    <h3>The Church Door</h3>
    <blockquote>
        Two small bundles of fur, mewling in the cold night, left upon the threshold of the Moonmaiden's temple. The priests found them at dawn—Tabaxi cubs, barely old enough to see, abandoned but not unloved. A note in elegant script said only: "Keep them safe. The stars will guide them home."
    </blockquote>

    <div class="npc-card">
        <h3>Origins & Family</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Birth:</strong> Left on a Selûnite church doorstep as a cub</li>
            <li><strong>Sister:</strong> Nightrose (currently serves on Magnus Irongrip's crew aboard the <em>Silt Runner</em>)</li>
            <li><strong>Father:</strong> An angel (identity known to Ember)</li>
            <li><strong>Mother:</strong> A Tabaxi, believed dead by Ember's father—this is why the angel had the church raise his children</li>
            <li><strong>Tribe:</strong> Scattered by an unknown catastrophic event</li>
            <li><strong>Raised By:</strong> Selûnite clergy who found the cubs</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>The Scattered Tribe</h3>
    <div class="info-box" style="border-left: 4px solid #8b0000;">
        <h4>Mystery of the Dispersion</h4>
        <p>Something happened to Ember's tribe—an event so devastating it scattered his people to the winds. The nature of this catastrophe remains unknown, buried in the gaps between his father's carefully chosen words and the silence of the stars. Was it an attack? A curse? Divine intervention? The answer may hold the key to Ember's past and his future.</p>

        <p><strong>What is Known:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The tribe was scattered by a single, significant event</li>
            <li>Ember's father believes his mother perished in this event</li>
            <li>The angel father chose to have the church raise his cubs rather than keep them himself</li>
            <li>The reason for abandonment was protection, not rejection</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Unanswered Questions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>What exactly happened to the tribe?</li>
            <li>Is Ember's mother truly dead, or does his father simply believe it?</li>
            <li>Why did the angel not raise his children himself?</li>
            <li>Are there other survivors of the scattered tribe?</li>
            <li>What role does Ember's celestial heritage play in the tribe's fate?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Faith & Calling</h2>

    <h3>Minister of Selûne</h3>
    <p>Raised in the temple, Ember naturally embraced the faith of his caretakers. The Moonmaiden's teachings of protection, navigation through darkness, and the cycles of transformation resonated deeply with the young Tabaxi. He became not merely a worshiper but a minister—one who guides others to Selûne's light.</p>

    <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #f0f0ff; border-left: 4px solid #9370db;">
        <h3>Selûnite Beliefs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Moon's Guidance:</strong> Selûne lights the path through darkness, both literal and metaphorical</li>
            <li><strong>Protection of the Lost:</strong> Special care for wanderers, travelers, and the abandoned</li>
            <li><strong>Cycles & Change:</strong> All things wax and wane; transformation is sacred</li>
            <li><strong>Light Against Evil:</strong> Eternal opposition to Shar and the darkness that corrupts</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Stars guide those who are lost; hope endures</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>The Hollyphant Patron</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "You seek answers written in starlight, little one. I will lend you the power to read them."
    </blockquote>

    <div class="npc-card">
        <h4>The Celestial Pact</h4>
        <p>Ember's patron is a Hollyphant—a small, elephant-headed celestial being of tremendous wisdom and gentle power. These rare creatures serve as agents of good throughout the planes, and their choice of warlocks is never random.</p>

        <p><strong>Patron's Nature:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Form:</strong> Hollyphant (tiny winged elephant, radiating golden light)</li>
            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Lawful Good</li>
            <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Guided Ember to uncover the truth of his heritage and reunite scattered good</li>
            <li><strong>Powers Granted:</strong> Celestial magic, protective abilities, divination</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Dreams, visions of starlight, gentle whispers in moments of meditation</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The Pact's Purpose:</strong></p>
        <p>The Hollyphant sees in Ember a bridge between worlds—mortal and celestial, lost and found. The pact empowers Ember to seek truth, protect the innocent, and perhaps discover what really happened to his tribe and mother. The patron believes Ember's quest is part of a larger cosmic pattern, though the full design remains hidden even from the Hollyphant's ancient eyes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Relationship with Nightrose</h2>

    <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #fff8f0; border-left: 4px solid #ff6b6b;">
        <h3>Sister & Shipmate</h3>
        <p><strong>Nightrose</strong> chose a different path than her brother. While Ember remained with the temple, devoted to Selûne's service and the pursuit of divine knowledge, Nightrose sought freedom and adventure on the waves. She serves aboard Magnus Irongrip's ship, the <em>Silt Runner</em>, as part of his crew.</p>

        <p><strong>Their Bond:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shared childhood in the temple</li>
            <li>Only family each has known for certain</li>
            <li>Both seek answers about their heritage, but in different ways</li>
            <li>Nightrose's practical, action-oriented nature balances Ember's spiritual contemplation</li>
            <li>Connection to Magnus provides Ember with Harper contacts and transport</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Different Paths:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ember: Faith, magic, divine mysteries</li>
            <li>Nightrose: Freedom, the sea, tangible action</li>
            <li>Yet both search for the same truth about their scattered tribe</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Character Development Paths</h2>

    <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #f5f5f5;">
        <h3>Potential Story Arcs</h3>

        <h4>Arc 1: The Mother's Trail</h4>
        <p>Discovery that his mother may still be alive, leading to a quest to find her and learn the truth of the scattering. The Hollyphant provides cryptic visions; Nightrose offers practical help.</p>

        <h4>Arc 2: Celestial Inheritance</h4>
        <p>Ember's angelic blood begins manifesting in unexpected ways. His father appears with warnings—or requests. The question of whether Ember will follow a celestial destiny or forge his own path.</p>

        <h4>Arc 3: The Scattered Tribe</h4>
        <p>Finding other survivors, learning they each hold pieces of the truth. Reuniting them could restore something precious—or awaken the very danger that scattered them.</p>

        <h4>Arc 4: Light Against Darkness</h4>
        <p>Jotunn's Tears and other infernal sites in the region draw Ember into conflict with devilish forces. His celestial heritage makes him particularly suited—and particularly vulnerable—to such confrontations.</p>

        <h4>Arc 5: The Hollyphant's Design</h4>
        <p>Discovery of the true reason the Hollyphant chose Ember. A cosmic purpose that ties together his heritage, the scattered tribe, and larger events in the region.</p>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Final Notes</h3>
        <p>Ember represents the intersection of divine purpose and personal quest. His journey to understand his past, his family, and his destiny can provide rich roleplaying opportunities and tie naturally into the campaign's themes of ancient magic, celestial/infernal conflict, and the search for belonging in a harsh frontier world.</p>
