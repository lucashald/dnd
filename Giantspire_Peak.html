    <h2>Geography & Description</h2>
    <blockquote>
        Towering over the village is the mist shrouded Giantspire Peak.
    </blockquote>

    <div class="info-box">
        <p>Giantspire Peak dominates the landscape around Fjord's End, a massive mountain that rises dramatically from the fjord's edge. The peak is perpetually shrouded in mist and clouds, giving it an ethereal, almost otherworldly appearance. Its imposing presence serves as both a landmark for sailors and a constant reminder of the region's ancient and dangerous past.</p>

        <h3>Notable Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Mist Crown:</strong> Perpetual mists that crown the upper slopes, rarely dispersing even in clear weather</li>
            <li><strong>Northern Face:</strong> Sheer cliffs rising directly from the fjord waters</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden Valleys:</strong> Several glacial cirques and hidden valleys in the upper reaches</li>
            <li><strong>Ancient Mine Entrances:</strong> Sealed or collapsed dwarven mine shafts scattered across the slopes</li>
            <li><strong>The Dragon's Lair:</strong> Rumored to be somewhere in the highest reaches, now lost to time</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <div class="timeline-date">Age of Dragons (Circa 800-1000 years ago)</div>
            <p>Giantspire Peak served as the lair of a fearsome white dragon. The dragon's name has been lost to time, but legends speak of its devastating ice breath and the treasure hoard it amassed from raids on settlements throughout the region. The dragon claimed the entire mountain as its territory, and few dared approach the peak.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <div class="timeline-date">The Dragon War (Circa 700-800 years ago)</div>
            <p>A clan of dwarves, ancestors of Magnus Irongrip, ventured north from Earthfast seeking new mineral wealth. They discovered rich veins of ore within Giantspire Peak but faced the wrath of the white dragon that claimed the mountain. What followed was a brutal conflict that lasted for years.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <div class="timeline-date">The Slaying of the Dragon (Circa 700 years ago)</div>
            <p>Magnus's ancestor, wielding the legendary spear Snowpiercer—forged in the great forges of Earthfast—led a group of dwarven warriors in a final assault on the dragon's lair. In an epic battle among the frozen peaks, the dragon was slain. Snowpiercer pierced the dragon's heart, and the beast's death cry echoed through the mountains, causing avalanches that sealed portions of its lair forever.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <div class="timeline-date">The Dwarven Mine Era (Circa 700-500 years ago)</div>
            <p>With the dragon defeated, the dwarves established an extensive mining operation throughout Giantspire Peak. They delved deep into the mountain, following veins of precious metals and gemstones. The mine prospered for generations, and a small dwarven settlement grew on the mountainside. Trade routes were established with distant dwarven strongholds.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <div class="timeline-date">The Orc Invasion (Circa 500 years ago)</div>
            <p>A massive orc horde swept through the region, overwhelming the dwarven defenders. The mine was overrun in a brutal siege that lasted for months. The dwarves fought valiantly but were eventually forced to abandon their ancestral holding. The orcs claimed the mine, though they lacked the skill to maintain the deeper tunnels.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <div class="timeline-date">The Abandonment (Circa 400-500 years ago)</div>
            <p>The orc occupation proved short-lived. Whether driven out by cave-ins, underground dangers, or internal conflicts, the orcs eventually abandoned the mine. Some say they delved too deep and awakened something best left sleeping. Others claim the ghost of the slain dragon haunted the tunnels. Whatever the reason, Giantspire Peak has stood largely abandoned for centuries.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <div class="timeline-date">Present Day</div>
            <p>Giantspire Peak remains a landmark and a source of legends. The old mine entrances can still be found by those who know where to look, though most are sealed by cave-ins or deliberately collapsed. Local folklore warns against disturbing the mountain, speaking of curses, treasures, and dangers that still lurk in the ancient tunnels.</p>

    <h2>Snowpiercer: The Dragon-Slaying Spear</h2>

    <div class="artifact-box">
        <h3>Snowpiercer <span class="legend-tag">LEGENDARY ARTIFACT</span></h3>

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Snowpiercer is a magnificent spear forged in the legendary forges of Earthfast, the great dwarven stronghold. The weapon was specifically created to combat the white dragon of Giantspire Peak, imbued with powerful magic designed to pierce dragon scales and resist elemental cold.</p>

        <h4>Physical Appearance</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shaft:</strong> Crafted from ironwood reinforced with mithral bands, inscribed with dwarven runes</li>
            <li><strong>Spearhead:</strong> Forged from adamantine with a core of enchanted ice that never melts</li>
            <li><strong>Length:</strong> 8 feet from butt to tip, perfectly balanced</li>
            <li><strong>Decorations:</strong> The shaft bears carvings depicting the journey from Earthfast to Giantspire Peak</li>
            <li><strong>Aura:</strong> Emanates a faint chill and produces tiny ice crystals in humid air</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Known Powers</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhanced damage against dragons, particularly white dragons</li>
            <li>Resistance or immunity to cold damage for the wielder</li>
            <li>Ability to pierce magical defenses and dragon scales</li>
            <li>Rumored to grant the wielder protection from dragon fear</li>
            <li>May possess additional powers yet to be discovered</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Spear's Legacy</h4>
        <p>After the dragon's death, Snowpiercer became a clan heirloom, passed down through Magnus's family line. The weapon's current whereabouts are unknown—it may have been lost during the orc invasion, hidden away for safekeeping, or carried to distant lands by clan members who fled the mountain.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mystery">
        <h4>Questions About Snowpiercer</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Does Magnus know the spear's current location?</li>
            <li>Was it lost in the mine when the orcs attacked?</li>
            <li>Could it still be hidden somewhere in Giantspire Peak?</li>
            <li>Did another branch of the family carry it away?</li>
            <li>Might the weapon be needed again to face a new draconic threat?</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>The Dragon of Giantspire</h2>

    <div class="dragon-box">
        <h3>The White Wyrm of the North</h3>

        <p>Though the dragon's true name has been lost to history—perhaps deliberately forgotten by those who feared even speaking it might summon the beast's vengeful spirit—the legends paint a vivid picture of its reign of terror.</p>

        <h4>The Dragon's Domain</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Territory:</strong> Claimed all of Giantspire Peak and the surrounding valleys</li>
            <li><strong>Lair:</strong> A massive ice cavern in the highest reaches of the mountain</li>
            <li><strong>Hoard:</strong> Accumulated over centuries of raiding coastal settlements and caravans</li>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Ancient, possibly one of the oldest white dragons in the region</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Terror of the Fjords</h4>
        <p>For generations, the dragon terrorized the region. Ships sailing the fjords would be attacked from above, their crews frozen by the dragon's breath before being torn apart. Settlements lived in constant fear, paying tribute or abandoning their homes entirely. The dragon's shadow over the land ended only with its death at the hands of Magnus's ancestor.</p>

        <h4>The Final Battle</h4>
        <blockquote>
            According to legend, the battle raged for three days and nights. The dwarves fought their way through blizzards summoned by the dragon's fury, climbing ever higher toward its lair. When Magnus's ancestor finally drove Snowpiercer through the dragon's heart, the beast's death cry shook the mountain itself, causing massive avalanches that buried portions of the lair and sealed ancient tunnels forever.
        </blockquote>
    </div>

    <div class="mystery">
        <h4>Dragon Mysteries</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Was the dragon truly slain, or merely banished?</li>
            <li>What happened to the dragon's hoard?</li>
            <li>Are there dragon bones still preserved in ice somewhere on the peak?</li>
            <li>Did the dragon have offspring that escaped?</li>
            <li>Could the dragon's spirit still haunt the mountain?</li>

    <h2>The Dwarven Mine</h2>

    <div class="dwarf-box">
        <h3>The Lost Halls of Irongrip</h3>

        <p>The mine established by Magnus's ancestors was more than just a simple excavation—it was a masterwork of dwarven engineering, a subterranean complex that delved deep into the heart of Giantspire Peak.</p>

        <h4>Mine Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Great Hall:</strong> A massive central chamber carved from living rock, adorned with clan symbols</li>
            <li><strong>Multiple Levels:</strong> At least seven known levels, possibly more unexplored</li>
            <li><strong>Forge Complex:</strong> Industrial forges powered by volcanic vents deep in the mountain</li>
            <li><strong>Living Quarters:</strong> Residential areas capable of housing hundreds of dwarves</li>
            <li><strong>Treasury:</strong> Secure vaults where valuable ore and finished goods were stored</li>
            <li><strong>Defensive Works:</strong> Deliberately designed chokepoints and defensive positions</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Resources Extracted</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Silver and mithral from high-quality veins</li>
            <li>Gemstones, including diamonds and sapphires</li>
            <li>Iron ore for weapons and tools</li>
            <li>Rare minerals with magical properties</li>
            <li>Ice-touched crystals unique to the mountain</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Connection to Earthfast</h4>
        <p>The dwarves who established the mine were originally from Earthfast, one of the greatest dwarven strongholds. They brought with them the knowledge, skills, and traditions of that ancient city. Some legends claim they were attempting to establish a northern outpost of Earthfast, creating trade routes and expanding dwarven influence in the region.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h2>The Orc Occupation</h2>

    <div class="orc-box">
        <h3>The Fall of the Mine</h3>

        <p>The orc invasion that overwhelmed the dwarven mine was part of a larger horde movement through the region. The orcs saw the mine as a strategic stronghold and source of weapons.</p>

        <h4>The Siege</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Several months of brutal fighting</li>
            <li><strong>Dwarven Defenders:</strong> Outnumbered but fighting on familiar ground</li>
            <li><strong>Orc Tactics:</strong> Overwhelming numbers and savage determination</li>
            <li><strong>Final Days:</strong> Dwarves forced to seal sections and retreat</li>
            <li><strong>Evacuation:</strong> Survivors escaped through secret tunnels</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Orc Tenure</h4>
        <p>The orcs held the mine for perhaps 50-100 years, but their occupation was troubled:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lacked the skill to maintain deep tunnels</li>
            <li>Cave-ins became increasingly common</li>
            <li>Internal tribal conflicts weakened their hold</li>
            <li>Strange occurrences and disappearances plagued them</li>
            <li>Eventually abandoned the mine entirely</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Rumors of Why They Left</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Awakened something in the deep tunnels</li>
            <li>Haunted by the dragon's vengeful spirit</li>
            <li>Discovered the dragon's treasure and fought over it</li>
            <li>Released trapped dwarven spirits seeking revenge</li>
            <li>Simply found the mountain too inhospitable</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h2>Magnus Irongrip's Connection</h2>

    <div class="npc-card">
        <h3>Ancestral Legacy</h3>

        <p>Magnus Irongrip is a direct descendant of the dwarven hero who slew the dragon with Snowpiercer. This heritage weighs heavily on him, connecting him both to great glory and great loss.</p>

        <h4>What Magnus Knows</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Detailed oral histories of the dragon slaying passed down through generations</li>

            <li>Location of some (but not all) mine entrances</li>
            <li>Stories of the orc invasion and why his ancestors abandoned the mine</li>
            <li>Legends about Snowpiercer and its powers</li>

            <li><strong>Pride:</strong> In his ancestor's heroic deed</li>
            <li><strong>Loss:</strong> Of his family's ancestral home</li>
            <li><strong>Wariness:</strong> The mountain holds many dangers</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Magnus's Song</h4>
        <blockquote>
            The sight of the mountain seems to stir something in the ship's captain, a dwarf named Ingvar Runestone. He starts to sing.
        </blockquote>
        <p><em>Note: This was originally attributed to Magnus as ship captain. The song likely tells of the mountain's history and his family's deeds.</em></p>
