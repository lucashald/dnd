    <h2>Background & Origins</h2>

    <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #e6e6fa; border-left: 4px solid #9370db;">
        <h3>The Younger Evanara</h3>
        <p>Born on Evermeet, the sacred island homeland of the elves, Iawynn came to Silverymoon as a young elf when her older sister <a href="Tyrael_Evanara.html" style="color: #4682b4; font-weight: bold;">Tyrael</a> brought the family to the Silver Marches. At approximately 120 years old, she is young by elven standards—yet already a proven warrior, a devoted paladin, and a veteran of war.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Star Elf Heritage</h3>
    <div class="npc-card">
        <h4>The Mithral Elves</h4>
        <p>Star elves, also known as mithral elves, are among the rarest of elvenkind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Evermeet, the mystical isle hidden from mortal charts</li>
            <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Luminous pale skin, silver or white hair, eyes that reflect moonlight and starlight</li>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Contemplative, mystical, deeply connected to celestial phenomena</li>
            <li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Few star elves leave Evermeet; encountering one on the mainland is exceptional</li>
            <li><strong>Connection to Selûne:</strong> Many star elves feel a natural kinship with the moon goddess</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Life in Silverymoon:</strong> The City of Silver provided an ideal home for the displaced Evanara sisters. Its magical academies, libraries, and temples offered both Tyrael and Iawynn opportunities to develop their respective paths—psionics and divine service.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The War of the Silver Marches</h2>

    <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #ffe4e1; border-left: 4px solid #dc143c;">
        <h3>Baptism by Battle</h3>
        <p>When orc hordes descended upon the Silver Marches in recent years, Iawynn answered the call without hesitation. As a Silver Lady of Selûne, she fought on the front lines, her armor gleaming in moonlight, her sword blazing with holy fire.</p>

        <h4>Iawynn's Role in the War</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frontline Warrior:</strong> Led charges against orc formations</li>

            <li><strong>Destroyer of Evil:</strong> Hunted orc shamans and dark cultists</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Fighting Alongside Tyrael</h4>
        <p>While Iawynn fought openly in silver armor, her sister <a href="Tyrael_Evanara.html" style="color: #4682b4;">Tyrael</a> operated in the shadows—eliminating orc leaders with psychic blades, gathering intelligence, sabotaging supply lines. The sisters complemented each other perfectly:</p>

    <h2>Paladin Powers & Abilities</h2>

    <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #fffacd; border-left: 4px solid #ffd700;">
        <h3>Gifts of the Moonmaiden</h3>
        <p>As a paladin of Selûne, Iawynn channels divine power granted by her goddess:</p>

        <h4>Divine Smite</h4>
        <p>When her blade strikes evil, it erupts with moonlight—radiant energy that burns the wicked and illuminates darkness. Against fiends and undead, the power is especially devastating.</p>

        <h4>Lay on Hands</h4>
        <p>Selûne's healing touch flows through Iawynn's hands. She can cure wounds, diseases, and even neutralize poisons with a prayer and the Moonmaiden's grace.</p>

        <h4>Aura of Protection</h4>
        <p>Those who stand near Iawynn feel Selûne's protective presence—a shield of faith that wards against harm and bolsters courage.</p>

        <h4>Spellcasting</h4>
        <p>Iawynn can call upon Selûne for divine magic:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protection Spells:</strong> Shield of faith, warding bond, protection from evil</li>
            <li><strong>Healing Magic:</strong> Cure wounds, lesser restoration</li>
            <li><strong>Detection:</strong> Detect evil and good, locate object</li>
            <li><strong>Radiant Power:</strong> Moonbeam, searing smite, branding smite</li>
            <li><strong>Support:</strong> Bless, aid, heroism</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Divine Sense</h4>
        <p>Iawynn can sense the presence of powerful evil—fiends, undead, unholy objects. The ability resonates like moonlight revealing what hides in shadow.</p>

        <h4>Channel Divinity: Selûne's Gifts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Turn Undead:</strong> Command the walking dead to flee in Selûne's name</li>
            <li><strong>Moonfire:</strong> Channel radiant energy to harm enemies or light the darkest places</li>
            <li><strong>Lunar Guidance:</strong> Divine inspiration to aid allies or find the path forward</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h2>Relationship with Tyrael</h2>

    <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #fff8dc; border-left: 4px solid #9370db;">
        <h3>Sisters of Light and Shadow</h3>
        <p>The bond between Iawynn and <a href="Tyrael_Evanara.html" style="color: #4682b4;">Tyrael</a> is profound—forged by shared childhood, deepened by war, and tempered by their vastly different approaches to fighting evil.</p>

        <h4>Complementary Paths</h4>
        <p>Where Iawynn is light, Tyrael is shadow. Where Iawynn confronts evil openly with holy wrath, Tyrael eliminates it silently with psionic precision. Yet both serve the same cause: protecting the innocent and opposing darkness.</p>

        <h4>The Age Gap</h4>
        <p>Tyrael is approximately 80 years older than Iawynn—essentially, Tyrael helped raise her younger sister. This creates a dynamic where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tyrael is protective, sometimes overly so</li>
            <li>Iawynn respects her sister's experience but chafes at being "watched over"</li>
            <li>Tyrael sees the child she helped raise; Iawynn wants to be seen as an equal warrior</li>
            <li>Both love each other deeply but occasionally clash over methods and autonomy</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Different Methods, Shared Values</h4>
        <div class="npc-card">
            <p><strong>Iawynn's Perspective:</strong></p>
            <p>"Tyrael works in shadows because someone must. I do not always approve of her methods, but I trust her heart. She has saved more lives than she will ever claim credit for. While I stand in Selûne's light, she ensures no threat approaches from the darkness. We are two hands of the same purpose."</p>

            <p><strong>Potential Tensions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Honor vs. Pragmatism:</strong> Iawynn values honorable combat; Tyrael uses assassination and deception</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency vs. Secrecy:</strong> Paladins are sworn to truth; Harpers thrive on secrets</li>
                <li><strong>Protection vs. Independence:</strong> Tyrael wants to shield Iawynn; Iawynn wants to prove herself</li>
                <li><strong>Public vs. Private:</strong> Iawynn is known and celebrated; Tyrael works best unnoticed</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Unbreakable Bond:</strong></p>
            <p>Despite differences, the sisters would die for each other without hesitation. War proved that. They may argue over methods, but never over loyalty.</p>

    <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #f5f5f5;">
        <h3>Potential Story Arcs</h3>

        <h4>Arc 1: The Moonmaiden's Test</h4>
        <p>Selûne sends a divine vision or quest that tests Iawynn's faith, judgment, and compassion. Success could grant greater divine power or recognition within the Order of the Silver Ladies.</p>

        <h4>Arc 2: Shadow and Light</h4>
        <p>A situation forces Iawynn to rely on Tyrael's methods—deception, assassination, morally gray choices. Can she accept these methods? Can she forgive herself for using them?</p>

        <h4>Arc 3: Standing Alone</h4>
        <p>Separated from Tyrael, Iawynn must prove she can succeed independently. A mission where her sister cannot protect her from the shadows.</p>

        <h4>Arc 4: Cleansing the Darkness</h4>
        <p>Jotunn's Tears and other cursed sites become a personal crusade. Iawynn dedicates herself to purifying the region of infernal taint and ancient evil.</p>

        <h4>Arc 5: Return to Evermeet</h4>
        <p>Something calls the sisters back to their birthplace. Old secrets, family history, or a threat to the sacred isle itself requires their return.</p>

        <h4>Arc 6: The Cost of War</h4>
        <p>Trauma from the War of the Silver Marches resurfaces. Iawynn must confront survivor's guilt, loss, and the question of whether her sacrifices were worth it.</p>

        <h3>Final Notes</h3>
        <p>Iawynn represents the ideal of the paladin—courage, faith, and unwavering commitment to good. As a Silver Lady of Selûne, she stands as a beacon in dark places, a shield for the weak, and a sword against evil. Her youth (by elven standards) brings both idealism and room for growth, while her war experience has tempered her with hard-won wisdom. The relationship with her sister Tyrael provides rich roleplaying opportunities: mutual love and respect complicated by different methods and the challenge of stepping out from an elder sibling's protective shadow.</p>
        <p>Where Tyrael works unseen, Iawynn shines openly. Together, they are unstoppable—one sister illuminates the path, the other guards it from the darkness that others never see.</p>
