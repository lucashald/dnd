        <h3>⚠️ Environmental Hazard ⚠️</h3>
        <p><strong>Icelace Lake is deadly to the unprepared.</strong></p>
        <p>The waters are bitterly cold and can cause hypothermia in minutes. The ice in winter is thick but treacherous, with hidden cracks and thin spots. Predators—both natural and unnatural—are drawn to the lake's abundant wildlife.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Geography</h2>

    <div class="geography-box">
        <h3>Physical Description</h3>

        <p>Icelace Lake is a long, narrow body of water that stretches across much of northern Narfell, acting as a natural barrier between the populated regions and the Great Glacier to the north. The lake is fed entirely by glacial runoff, giving its waters their distinctive pale blue-white color and numbing cold.</p>

        <h4>Dimensions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Length:</strong> Approximately 150 miles from north to south</li>
            <li><strong>Width:</strong> Varies from 5 to 25 miles, widest in the central basin</li>
            <li><strong>Depth:</strong> 200-400 feet in deepest sections</li>
            <li><strong>Surface Area:</strong> Roughly 1,500 square miles</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Characteristics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Color:</strong> Pale blue-white due to suspended glacial sediment and depth</li>
            <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Never above 45°F even in summer; drops to freezing in winter</li>
            <li><strong>Ice Coverage:</strong> Frozen solid from late autumn through early spring (4-5 months)</li>
            <li><strong>Ice Thickness:</strong> Can reach 3-4 feet in harsh winters, 1-2 feet normally</li>
            <li><strong>Currents:</strong> Relatively calm, though underwater currents from glacial inflow can be dangerous</li>
            <li><strong>Glacial Discharge:</strong> The northern end feeds directly from three major glacial valleys</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Surrounding Landscape</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Northern Shore:</strong> Rocky, glacier-carved coastline with steep cliffs and fjords</li>
            <li><strong>Eastern Shore:</strong> Pine forests giving way to tundra as you move north</li>
            <li><strong>Western Shore:</strong> More gentle, with meadows and river valleys</li>
            <li><strong>Southern End:</strong> Transitions to rolling hills and more temperate terrain</li>
            <li><strong>Islands:</strong> Several rocky islands dot the lake, some with ruins of ancient settlements</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Ecology & Wildlife</h2>

    <div class="wildlife-box">
        <h3>Fish Populations</h3>

        <p>Despite the harsh conditions, Icelace Lake teems with fish—the primary reason people brave its frigid waters.</p>

        <h4>Native Species</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arctic Salmon:</strong> Large, strong fish weighing 10-20 pounds; best in spring and fall runs</li>
            <li><strong>Lake Trout:</strong> Year-round availability; smaller than salmon but abundant</li>
            <li><strong>Char:</strong> Deep-water species; harder to catch but prized for their flavor</li>
            <li><strong>Whitefish:</strong> Small, silvery fish; used for bait and food</li>
            <li><strong>Pike:</strong> Predatory fish; aggressive and dangerous if provoked in shallow water</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Fishing Seasons</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spring (Thaw):</strong> Salmon run; most abundant and easiest to catch</li>
            <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Good fishing in deeper waters; some danger from overheating</li>
            <li><strong>Autumn (Pre-Freeze):</strong> Final salmon run; fish are aggressive and fat</li>
            <li><strong>Winter (Frozen):</strong> Ice fishing through holes; dangerous but productive</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Other Wildlife</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bears:</strong> Drawn to the lake by fish abundance; extremely dangerous during salmon runs</li>
            <li><strong>Wolves:</strong> Hunt along the shores, particularly in winter</li>
            <li><strong>Water Birds:</strong> Geese, ducks, loons; migrate seasonally</li>
            <li><strong>Seals:</strong> Rare, but occasionally seen in deeper northern waters</li>
            <li><strong>Otters:</strong> Scarce; hunted for their valuable pelts</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Predatory Hazards</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Giant Pike:</strong> Unnatural versions inhabit the deepest parts of the lake; 8-12 feet long</li>
            <li><strong>Lake Monsters:</strong> Rumors of something large moving in the depths, particularly in winter</li>
            <li><strong>Dire Bears:</strong> The glacial valleys occasionally produce bears of unnatural size and ferocity</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h2>Settlements & Locations</h2>

    <div class="settlement-box">
        <h3>Inhabited Areas</h3>

        <h4>Nar Tribes</h4>
        <p>Various tribes of Nar, the indigenous people of Narfell, have established settlements along Icelace Lake's shores. These are semi-nomadic communities that follow the seasonal fish runs.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Whitefin Tribe:</strong> Controls the southern and eastern shores; known for expert fishermen</li>
            <li><strong>Glacierbane Tribe:</strong> Northern settlements; hardiest and most aggressive</li>
            <li><strong>Rivermouth Tribe:</strong> Western shore settlements; traders and craftspeople</li>
            <li><strong>Seasonal Camps:</strong> Temporary fishing villages established during spawning runs</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Notable Locations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Whitefin Landing:</strong> Largest semi-permanent settlement (150-200 inhabitants); trading hub</li>
            <li><strong>Ghost Rock Island:</strong> Ancient ruins suggest pre-Nar habitation; now considered cursed</li>
            <li><strong>The Narrows:</strong> Dangerous choke point where the lake is only 3 miles wide; strong currents</li>
            <li><strong>Salmon Falls:</strong> Where three rivers feed into the southern end; spawning ground of massive salmon</li>
            <li><strong>The Glacier Gate:</strong> Northern inlet where glacial valleys meet the lake; treacherous and beautiful</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Ancient Ruins</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Several islands contain the ruins of Narfelli settlements from centuries past</li>
            <li>Most have been deliberately abandoned—locals avoid them after dark</li>
            <li>Some ruins show signs of infernal rituals or demonic habitation</li>
            <li>Archaeological value is significant but danger is extreme</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h2>Activities & Resources</h2>

    <div class="activity-box">
        <h3>Fishing</h3>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="activity-box">
        <h3>Travel & Trade Routes</h3>

        <p>The lake serves as both a barrier and a highway, depending on the season and the traveler's capabilities.</p>

        <h4>Water Routes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Summer Travel:</strong> Boats can navigate the open water; journey across takes 5-7 days</li>
            <li><strong>Coastal Routes:</strong> Following the shore takes longer but is safer and allows supply stops</li>
            <li><strong>River Inlets:</strong> Several rivers feed the lake; can be followed inland for trade</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Ice Routes (Winter Only)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Direct Crossing:</strong> Possible with proper equipment; 1-2 days across the widest point</li>
            <li><strong>Dangers:</strong> Thin spots, invisible cracks, whiteouts, cold exposure</li>
            <li><strong>Guidance:</strong> Local Nar provide winter guides for significant payment</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Land Routes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Around the Lake:</strong> Longer but safer; follows established trails and settlements</li>
            <li><strong>Mountain Passes:</strong> Shorter but extremely dangerous; avalanches and uncharted territory</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Lore & Mysteries</h2>

    <div class="wildlife-box">
        <h3>Local Legends</h3>

        <h4>The Lake's Curse</h4>
        <p>Local Nar speak of an old curse on the lake, supposedly connected to Narfelli infernalists who tried to bind a water elemental in the lake centuries ago. The ritual went wrong, they say, and something was trapped beneath the ice. Fishermen report:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Strange lights under the ice in winter</li>
            <li>Waters that move against the current</li>
            <li>Boats found empty, as if their crews simply vanished</li>
            <li>Fish with unusual mutations or unnatural colors</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Deep One</h4>
        <p>Older Nar refuse to fish in the deepest central basin, speaking of something "old and large" that dwells there. They describe:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A shape glimpsed in the water's depths during summer</li>
            <li>Ice that cracks from underneath in patterns that seem almost purposeful</li>
            <li>The water sometimes taking on an oily, iridescent quality</li>
            <li>Fishermen who ventured too deep and returned... changed somehow</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Ghost Rock Island</h4>
        <p>This island's ruins are known to be cursed. Local tales say:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>It was a Narfelli military outpost during their empire</li>
            <li>The garrison was destroyed in a demonic incursion</li>
            <li>Soldiers' spirits still guard the ruins</li>
            <li>The ruins contain infernal artifacts of considerable power and danger</li>
            <li>Survivors report hearing screams on the wind despite the island's emptiness</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Winter Wars</h4>
        <p>Occasionally, the deep ice breaks and reveals ancient bodies or weapons from conflicts fought centuries ago. Scholars believe:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Narfelli forces fought Raumathar armies on the frozen lake</li>
            <li>Powerful magic was used, possibly causing permanent damage</li>
            <li>Entire armies were lost, their remains still preserved in ice</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>DM Notes</h2>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Running Icelace Lake</h3>

        <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
        <p>The lake should feel vast, isolating, and dangerous:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emphasize the endless horizon and the sense of exposure on open water or ice</li>
            <li>Describe the silence of the frozen lake—eerily quiet in winter</li>
            <li>Use temperature as a constant threat and clock (how long can they last?)</li>
            <li>Add sensory details: the crunch of ice, the calls of distant birds, the smell of fish</li>
            <li>Make the Nar feel like locals with deep knowledge of a harsh but survivable land</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Seasonal Variations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spring (Thaw):</strong> Water access but dangerous ice breaks; salmon runs; bears aggressive</li>
            <li><strong>Summer:</strong> Open water navigation; comfortable temperature; maximum travel difficulty minimal</li>
            <li><strong>Autumn (Pre-Freeze):</strong> Final fishing season; weather becoming unstable; freezing begins</li>
            <li><strong>Winter (Frozen):</strong> Solid ice; extreme cold; isolation; limited daylight</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Scaling Difficulty</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Level 1-4:</strong> Focus on environmental challenges and Nar interactions; avoid major monsters</li>
            <li><strong>Level 5-8:</strong> Introduce wilderness encounters; minor supernatural elements; possible creature sightings</li>
            <li><strong>Level 9-12:</strong> Explore Ghost Rock ruins; confront lake mysteries; deal with larger threats</li>
            <li><strong>Level 13+:</strong> Encounter major supernatural threats; break ancient curses; explore deepest secrets</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Environmental Rules</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cold Exposure:</strong> Constitution save DC 10 every hour; failure = one level exhaustion</li>
            <li><strong>Hypothermia:</strong> In water, save becomes DC 12 and happens every 5 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Winter Crossing:</strong> Requires navigation checks and awareness of thin ice hazards</li>
            <li><strong>Bears:</strong> Present but avoidable; become aggressive if provoked or food is left accessible</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Magical Considerations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Fire spells may be affected by the frigid environment (discuss with players)</li>
            <li>Ice magic is more potent here; cold-based attacks gain advantage</li>
            <li>Water breathing spells must contend with the numbing cold</li>
            <li>Infernal magic shows signs of its presence—faint sulfurous smells, unnatural reactions</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>NPC Relationships</h4>
        <p>The Nar tribes have distinct personalities and motivations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Whitefin Tribe:</strong> Hospitable traders; want to protect their fishing grounds</li>
            <li><strong>Glacierbane Tribe:</strong> Suspicious; test newcomers' competence and courage</li>
            <li><strong>Rivermount Tribe:</strong> Curious about outside world; good sources of information</li>
        </ul>
