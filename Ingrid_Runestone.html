While she appears to be a straightforward innkeeper, she serves as a valuable Harper affiliate and intelligence contact, working closely with <a href="Skylark.html">Skylark</a>.

            <h2>Appearance & Background</h2>
            <p>Ingrid stands at a height between her parents—taller than a typical dwarf but shorter than a full human. She bears her dwarven father's sturdy frame and practical nature, while her human mother's heritage manifests in her facial features and longer stature. She maintains a warm, professional demeanor that makes visitors feel at home and loosens tongues over ale and hearth fires.</p>

            <p>Ingrid is discreet, professional, and reliable. Those seeking Harper contacts or requiring secure communication channels should approach her with appropriate discretion.

            <p>She prefers to conduct sensitive business in private rather than at the bar, and often takes a personal interest in the well-being of those she helps. Her information network is extensive but carefully maintained—she reveals only what is necessary and trusts sparingly.</p>
