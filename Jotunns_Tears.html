    <h2>The Pool</h2>

    <blockquote>
        The glacial pool stretches before you like a mirror of black ice, its surface so still it might be solid. But you can see the faint shimmer of movement beneath, and the water itself seems to pulse with a malevolent blue light that seems to come from deep below. Ancient runes are carved into the surrounding stone—giant script that predates any human settlement, though beneath them you can make out older, more sinister markings in a language that makes your eyes hurt to perceive.

        The air here is wrong. Too cold, too still, too quiet. No birds sing. No insects buzz. Even the wind seems reluctant to disturb this place. The water gives off a faint mist that clings to the ground like grasping fingers, and you could swear you hear distant whispers in languages older than memory.
    </blockquote>

    <div class="info-box">

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h2>The Curse</h2>

    <div class="curse-box">
        <h3>Infernal Transformation</h3>

        <p>The pool's curse is ancient, cruel, and multifaceted. It was designed not just to punish, but to corrupt—to take the natural order and twist it into something grotesque and violent.</p>

        <h4>Primary Effect: Monstrous Mutation</h4>
        <p>Any creature that drinks from the pool undergoes a horrific transformation:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Size Increase:</strong> Grows to Huge size (or one size category larger if already Huge), approximately 10-20x original mass</li>
            <li><strong>Physical Changes:</strong> Body warps and changes—fur becomes matted with ice, eyes glow with unnatural light, claws and teeth enlarge</li>
            <li><strong>Elemental Affinity:</strong> Gains resistance or immunity to cold, radiates freezing aura</li>
            <li><strong>Strength Enhancement:</strong> Dramatic increase in physical power (Strength increases by 6-10 points)</li>
            <li><strong>Pain:</strong> Transformation is agonizing and never truly ends—creature is in constant pain</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Permanent unless powerful magic is used to reverse it</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Secondary Effect: Madness</h4>
        <p>The curse doesn't just change the body—it breaks the mind:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rage:</strong> Overwhelming, uncontrollable fury at all living things</li>
            <li><strong>Hunger:</strong> Insatiable desire to consume, though nothing sates it</li>
            <li><strong>Paranoia:</strong> Believes everything is a threat or trying to steal from it</li>
            <li><strong>Confusion:</strong> Can't remember its former life, recognizes nothing familiar</li>
            <li><strong>Compulsion:</strong> Driven to return to the pool periodically, though drinking again worsens the curse</li>
            <li><strong>Susceptibility:</strong> Intelligent creatures suffer more—the curse feeds on complex thought</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Progression</h4>
        <p>The curse worsens over time:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hours 1-24:</strong> Transformation completes, pain is most intense, mind begins to fracture</li>
            <li><strong>Days 2-7:</strong> Madness takes hold, creature becomes violently aggressive</li>
            <li><strong>Weeks 2-4:</strong> Loses all memory of former existence, operates on pure instinct and rage</li>
            <li><strong>Months 2+:</strong> Additional mutations may occur, creature becomes walking disaster</li>
            <li><strong>Years 1+:</strong> Some victims become so changed they're barely recognizable as their original species</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Game Mechanics</h4>
        <p><strong>Drinking from the Pool:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Constitution Save DC 18</strong> to resist initial effects</li>
            <li><strong>Failure:</strong> Transformation begins immediately, completes in 1d4 hours</li>
            <li><strong>Success:</strong> Creature takes 4d10 necrotic damage and is poisoned for 24 hours, but avoids transformation</li>
            <li><strong>Wisdom Save DC 16</strong> (after transformation) to resist madness for 24 hours; must repeat daily</li>
            <li><strong>Repeated Exposure:</strong> Each additional drink lowers save DCs by 2 (cumulative)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Reversal</h4>
        <p>Breaking the curse is extremely difficult:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Greater Restoration</strong> cast at 7th level or higher (within first week only)</li>
            <li><strong>Wish</strong> or <strong>Divine Intervention</strong> (any time)</li>
            <li><strong>Special Ritual:</strong> Requires rare components, knowledge of the original pact, and breaking the devil's hold</li>
            <li><strong>Death and True Resurrection:</strong> Killing the creature and using True Resurrection bypasses the curse</li>
            <li><strong>The Devil's Release:</strong> Finding and defeating/negotiating with the devil who created the curse</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>History: The Narfell Noble's Bargain</h2>

    <div class="narfell-box">
        <h3>The Empire of Narfell</h3>

        <p>Over a thousand years ago, the Empire of Narfell ruled these lands. The Narfelli were powerful demon-binders and infernalists, their empire built on pacts with dark powers from the Lower Planes. They raised great cities and commanded armies of bound demons, but their hubris would be their downfall.</p>

        <h4>Timeline</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Circa -900 DR:</strong> The Narfell Empire at its height, controlling vast northern territories</li>
            <li><strong>Circa -700 DR:</strong> Lord Valthrun Kros builds his estate at what is now Jotunn's Tears</li>
            <li><strong>Circa -650 DR:</strong> Valthrun makes his pact with the devil Azarokh</li>
            <li><strong>Circa -160 DR:</strong> The Narfell Empire falls in war with Raumathar</li>
            <li><strong>Present Day:</strong> The pool remains cursed, a festering wound in reality</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="devil-box">
        <h3>Lord Valthrun Kros and the Devil's Pact</h3>

        <h4>The Noble</h4>
        <p>Lord Valthrun Kros was a Narfelli nobleman of moderate standing who craved greater power. His estate overlooked a pristine glacial tarn in the high mountains—a place of beauty and tranquility. But Valthrun was not content with beauty; he wanted dominion.</p>

        <h4>The Desire</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Sought to become one of the great demon-binders of the empire</li>
            <li>Wanted to command armies and conquer neighboring territories</li>
            <li>Desired immortality and power beyond mortal ken</li>
            <li>Envied rivals who had made successful infernal pacts</li>
            <li>Believed he was clever enough to outwit a devil</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Devil: Azarokh the Corruptor</h4>
        <p>Azarokh was a pit fiend of considerable power who specialized in twisted bargains. He didn't just want souls—he wanted to create lasting monuments to corruption, places where evil would endure long after empires fell.</p>

        <p><strong>Azarokh's True Goal:</strong> Create a permanent source of cursed, maddened creatures that would plague the region for millennia, spreading chaos and fear long after Narfell's fall.</p>

        <h4>The Bargain</h4>
        <p>Valthrun summoned Azarokh and made his demand: power, longevity, and dominion over his enemies. The devil agreed, with terms:</p>

        <blockquote style="background-color: #1a1a2e; color: #ff6b6b; border-left: 4px solid #8b0000;">
            "I grant you power beyond measure—strength to crush armies, years beyond counting, dominion over all who oppose you. In exchange, I ask but three small things:

            First, your estate and all upon it shall be mine when you tire of life.

            Second, the waters of your beautiful tarn shall carry my gift to all who drink.

            Third, when you finally embrace death, your essence shall join the waters, that you might witness my gift's work for all eternity."
        </blockquote>

        <h4>The Deception</h4>
        <p>Valthrun, arrogant and foolish, agreed. He thought:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"I will never tire of life—I'll be immortal!"</li>
            <li>"A gift to those who drink sounds beneficial—blessed waters for my people!"</li>
            <li>"My essence in the water means I'll be remembered forever!"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>He was wrong on all counts.</p>

        <h4>The Curse Manifests</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Day One:</strong> Valthrun gains immense power—strength, vitality, magical might</li>
            <li><strong>Week One:</strong> His servants drink from the tarn, seeking to share his blessing—they transform into monsters</li>
            <li><strong>Week Two:</strong> The monsters, now mad, slaughter everyone in the estate including Valthrun's family</li>
            <li><strong>Month One:</strong> Valthrun, now alone and horrified, confronts the monsters—his newfound power lets him defeat them</li>
            <li><strong>Month Two:</strong> He realizes he cannot leave the estate—the pact binds him here</li>
            <li><strong>Year One:</strong> He begins to go mad from isolation and guilt</li>
            <li><strong>Year Ten:</strong> He can no longer bear existence and seeks death, but finds he cannot die</li>
            <li><strong>Year Fifty:</strong> Completely mad, he throws himself into the tarn, fulfilling the third clause</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Valthrun's Fate</h4>
        <p>Valthrun's essence dissolved into the waters, becoming part of the curse. He remains there still, a fragment of consciousness trapped in eternal torment, forced to witness every creature that drinks and transforms. Some say his screams can be heard in the whispers that emanate from the pool. Others say his face appears in the water's depths, frozen in eternal anguish.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="narfell-box">
        <h3>The Ruins of Valthrun's Estate</h3>

        <p>The estate that once stood here is long gone, but ruins remain:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Foundation Stones:</strong> Ancient blocks carved with Narfelli script and infernal runes</li>
            <li><strong>Collapsed Columns:</strong> Marble pillars now toppled and overgrown (with dead vegetation)</li>
            <li><strong>The Summoning Circle:</strong> Where Valthrun called Azarokh—still faintly active, dangerous to enter</li>
            <li><strong>Underground Chambers:</strong> Partially collapsed cellars and dungeons beneath the estate</li>
            <li><strong>The Pact Stone:</strong> A black basalt altar where the deal was sealed, inscribed with the terms in Infernal</li>
            <li><strong>Skeletal Remains:</strong> Bones of Valthrun's household, some showing signs of mutation</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>What Can Be Found</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ancient Narfelli artifacts and texts (mostly ruined)</li>
            <li>The written pact between Valthrun and Azarokh (on the Pact Stone)</li>
            <li>Clues to the curse's nature and possible reversal methods</li>
            <li>Remnants of Valthrun's library—knowledge of demon-binding (cursed knowledge)</li>
            <li>Personal effects revealing the tragedy that unfolded</li>
            <li>Possibly: a way to contact or summon Azarokh (extremely dangerous)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h2>The Giant Script</h2>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>The False Legend</h3>

        <p>The pool is called "Jotunn's Tears" because of the giant-runes carved around its perimeter. These runes tell a story—but it's a lie, crafted by Azarokh to obscure the truth and add another layer of cruelty to his work.</p>

        <h4>The Carved Tale</h4>
        <p>The giant runes tell the story of a frost giant parent whose child drowned in the tarn. In grief, the giant wept into the waters for seven days and seven nights, cursing the pool so that any who drank from it would feel the pain of loss as the giant did.</p>

        <p><em>This is completely false.</em> The devil carved these runes to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Obscure the true infernal nature of the curse</li>
            <li>Create sympathy for a fictional tragedy</li>
            <li>Misdirect anyone trying to understand or break the curse</li>
            <li>Mock the concept of parental love by associating it with corruption</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Infernal Script</h4>
        <p>Beneath the giant runes, barely visible and painful to perceive, are the true markings—written in Infernal. These describe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The actual terms of Valthrun's pact</li>
            <li>The mechanism of the curse</li>
            <li>Azarokh's true name (dangerous to speak)</li>
            <li>Hints toward breaking the curse (deliberately cryptic)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Reading the Infernal Script:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Requires fluency in Infernal or Comprehend Languages</li>
            <li>Wisdom save DC 14 or take 2d6 psychic damage from perceiving infernal truth</li>
            <li>Reading Azarokh's true name: Wisdom save DC 16 or be Frightened for 1 minute</li>
            <li>Complete translation requires several hours and risks attracting attention</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h2>Approaches to the Pool</h2>

    <div class="approach-box">
        <h3>Routes to Jotunn's Tears</h3>

        <p>The pool sits at approximately 10,000 feet elevation in a glacial cirque accessible by several routes, each with its own dangers.</p>

        <h4>Route 1: The Northern Climb (Standard)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> 2 days from Fjord's End</li>

            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> 1 day from Giantspire Peak mine entrance</li>
            <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Variable</li>
            <li><strong>Terrain:</strong> Ancient dwarven tunnels, collapsed passages, underground lakes</li>
            <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> Cave-ins, underground creatures, getting lost, toxic gases</li>
            <li><strong>Stealth:</strong> Excellent—emerge near the pool with cover</li>
            <li><strong>Recommended:</strong> For parties who have explored the mine and found the connection</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Route 4: Magical Transport (Expensive)</h4>

            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Teleportation Circle, Wind Walk, Fly, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Depends on resources</li>
            <li><strong>Hazards:</strong> Magical wards around the pool may interfere</li>
            <li><strong>Stealth:</strong> Variable—sudden arrival may trigger reactions</li>
            <li><strong>Recommended:</strong> For high-level parties or those with NPC assistance</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="tactical-box">
        <h3>Environmental Conditions</h3>

        <h4>Altitude Effects</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Thin Air:</strong> Constitution save DC 12 every hour or gain one level of exhaustion</li>
            <li><strong>Acclimatization:</strong> Spending 24 hours at 8,000+ feet grants advantage on saves</li>
            <li><strong>Spell Effects:</strong> Fire spells deal half damage due to reduced oxygen</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Can be used to push enemies into cursed water</li>
            <li>Transformed creatures may be drawn to defend it</li>
            <li>Spells involving water may behave unpredictably</li>
            <li>Swimming in it is suicide (instant exposure to curse)</li>

    <h2>Breaking the Curse</h2>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Methods to End Jotunn's Tears</h3>

        <p>Permanently ending the curse is a quest unto itself, requiring multiple steps:</p>

        <h4>Option 1: Fulfill the Pact</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Find a way to contact Azarokh (via Summoning Circle or other means)</li>
            <li>Negotiate release of the curse (requires something of equal value)</li>
            <li>Possible trades: souls, service, spreading corruption elsewhere</li>
            <li><span class="hazard">WARNING:</span> Dealing with pit fiends is extremely dangerous</li>
            <li>Azarokh may demand the party help him escape imprisonment or perform dark deeds</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Option 2: Divine Intervention</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Seek aid from a powerful good deity</li>
            <li>Requires completing a holy quest or pilgrimage</li>
            <li>May need to transport large quantities of holy water to the pool</li>
            <li>Ritual to consecrate the pool and drive out infernal presence</li>
            <li>Could involve battle with devils sent to stop the purification</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Option 3: Arcane Reversal</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Study the Pact Stone and Infernal script to understand curse mechanics</li>
            <li>Gather rare components: devil's blood, tears of a penitent fiend, etc.</li>
            <li>Perform counter-ritual designed to unweave the curse</li>
            <li>Requires high-level spellcaster (9th level spells or multiple 7th level casters)</li>
            <li>Risky—failure might strengthen the curse or attract Azarokh's wrath</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Option 4: Destroy the Pool</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Physically obliterate the pool with massive force</li>
            <li>Would require multiple Earthquakes, collapsing the cirque</li>
            <li>Or: redirect glacier to bury it under ice permanently</li>
            <li><span class="hazard">WARNING:</span> Cursed water might seep into groundwater, spreading curse</li>
            <li>May only seal the problem rather than solve it</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Option 5: Redeem Valthrun</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Find and communicate with Valthrun's tortured spirit</li>
            <li>Help him find peace, breaking his connection to the curse</li>
            <li>May weaken the curse enough for other methods to work</li>
            <li>Could involve recovering his remains and giving proper burial</li>
            <li>Requires understanding his guilt and offering genuine forgiveness</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>DM Notes</h2>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Running Jotunn's Tears</h3>

        <h4>Atmosphere</h4>
        <p>This location should feel oppressive, wrong, and dangerous:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emphasize the unnatural silence—no birds, no wind, no natural sounds</li>
            <li>Describe the pool's faint glow and the way it seems to pulse like breathing</li>
            <li>Whispers in unknown languages at the edge of hearing</li>
            <li>Sense of being watched by malevolent intelligence</li>
            <li>Physical discomfort—cold that seeps into bones, headache from altitude</li>
            <li>Time feels wrong here—hard to tell how long they've been present</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Foreshadowing</h4>
        <p>Build dread before the party ever reaches the pool:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>NPCs in Fjord's End tell dark legends about the place</li>
            <li>Kumari has books describing Narfelli curses (without full details)</li>
            <li>Encounter signs of transformed creatures on the approach</li>
            <li>Find old bones and equipment of previous explorers</li>
            <li>See the pool's glow from a distance at night</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pacing the Reveal</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>First Visit:</strong> Observe from distance, piece together giant-rune story (false legend)</li>
            <li><strong>Second Visit:</strong> Explore ruins, find Pact Stone, encounter Valthrun's ghost</li>
            <li><strong>Third Visit:</strong> Battle guardians, study Infernal script, begin planning cure</li>
            <li><strong>Final Visit:</strong> Execute plan to break curse, deal with Azarokh if necessary</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Scaling Difficulty</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Level 5-7:</strong> Focus on investigation, avoid direct conflict with curse</li>
            <li><strong>Level 8-10:</strong> Battle transformed creatures, explore ruins fully</li>
            <li><strong>Level 11-14:</strong> Confront infernal guardians, attempt to break curse</li>
            <li><strong>Level 15+:</strong> Deal with Azarokh directly, permanent resolution</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Consequences</h4>
        <p>Actions at the pool have lasting effects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Disturbing the Summoning Circle might alert Azarokh</li>
            <li>Damaging the pool could release cursed water downstream</li>
            <li>Learning Azarokh's true name gives power but draws attention</li>
            <li>Successfully breaking curse makes party famous (and targets)</li>
            <li>Failed attempts might strengthen the curse or create new problems</li>
        </ul>
