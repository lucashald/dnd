            <h2>Background & Faith</h2>
            <p>Kira came to Fjord's End years ago, drawn by the community's need and guided by her faith. She quickly established herself as the village's healer, combining practical knowledge of herbs, poultices, and medicines with her connection to the divine magic granted by the Triad.</p>

            <h3>The Shrine of the Triad</h3>
            <p>Rather than a grand church—impossible in a settlement as small as Fjord's End—Kira maintains the <strong>Shrine of the Triad</strong>, a modest but well-kept sacred space. The shrine serves multiple functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spiritual Center:</strong> A place where villagers come to pray, meditate, and seek blessing</li>
                <li><strong>Healing Temple:</strong> Where the wounded and sick come for treatment and prayer</li>
                <li><strong>Community Gathering:</strong> Hosts celebrations of holy days and communal worship</li>
                <li><strong>Counsel & Guidance:</strong> Where Kira provides spiritual advice and guidance to those in crisis</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The shrine is simple but reverent—adorned with holy symbols representing the three aspects of the Triad, with areas for prayer, meditation, and healing. Kira maintains it meticulously, and it stands as a beacon of hope and faith in the harsh northern landscape.</p>

            <h2>The Triad - Fjord's End's Faith</h2>
            <p>The Triad is the predominant religion practiced in Fjord's End. The community's faith in the Triad provides spiritual cohesion and values that guide their society. Though details of the Triad's specific theology vary, the faith emphasizes healing, protection, and community welfare—values that align well with survival in the harsh north.</p>

            <p>Kira serves as the primary interpreter of the Triad's teachings and the conduit for its divine blessings. She is both respected and beloved by the community for her wisdom and dedication to the faith.</p>
