        <p>Kumari is a striking half-elf woman with silver-streaked auburn hair typically worn in a loose braid draped over one shoulder.

    <h2>Background & History</h2>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>Kumari was born in a coastal city far to the south, the daughter of a human merchant and an elven scholar. She showed an early aptitude for languages and an insatiable appetite for stories. Her mother taught her the art of calligraphy and bookbinding, while her father's trade routes exposed her to tales from across the world.</p>

        <h3>The Wandering Years</h3>
        <p>In her twenties, Kumari spent nearly three decades traveling, working as a scribe, translator, and occasionally a teacher. She collected books wherever she went, slowly building what would become her shop's foundation. During this time, she also studied minor magic related to preservation, translation, and memory.</p>

        <h3>Arrival at Fjord's End</h3>
        <p>Sixty years ago, Kumari arrived in Fjord's End on a ship carrying a cargo of salvaged books from a flooded monastery. The ship's captain intended to sell them for scrap, but Kumari purchased the entire lot. Unable to afford passage elsewhere with her remaining coin, she stayed in the village, initially planning to leave once she'd sold enough books to fund her travels.</p>

        <p>She never left.</p>

        <p>The isolation, the dramatic landscape, and—though she won't admit it—the loneliness of the frontier folk who hungered for stories and knowledge, convinced her to make Fjord's End her home. She established The Northern Shelf in an abandoned storage house and has been the village's keeper of knowledge ever since.</p>

    <h2>Magical Abilities</h2>

    <div class="secret-box">
        <h3>Hidden Talents <span class="magical-notation">[DM Information]</span></h3>

        <p>While Kumari presents herself as merely a well-read bookseller, she possesses minor magical abilities related to knowledge and preservation:</p>

        <h4>Known Spells & Abilities</h4>

    <h2>Secrets & Mysteries</h2>

    <div class="secret-box">
        <h3>What Kumari Knows <span class="magical-notation">[DM Information]</span></h3>

        <p>After sixty years in Fjord's End and a lifetime of reading, Kumari knows more about the region's history and mysteries than almost anyone alive:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Giantspire Peak:</strong> Has three different historical accounts of the dragon's slaying, including one written by a dwarf who was there</li>
            <li><strong>The Cursed Pool:</strong> Possesses an ancient text describing similar giant-cursed sites throughout the north</li>
            <li><strong>Red Wizards:</strong> Has read extensively about Thayan methods and can identify their magical signature</li>
            <li><strong>Local Lore:</strong> Knows every legend, myth, and ghost story about the area</li>
            <li><strong>Hidden Locations:</strong> Old maps in her collection show ruins and sites long forgotten</li>
            <li><strong>Magnus's Lineage:</strong> Has researched his family tree extensively and knows details even he doesn't</li>
            <li><strong>The Harpers:</strong> Suspects Skylark's true affiliation, has helped him without being asked to join</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Kumari's Own Secret</h3>
        <p>Kumari is writing a comprehensive history of the northern reaches, a project she's been working on for forty years. The manuscript is nearly complete and contains information that would be invaluable—and dangerous—in the wrong hands. She keeps it hidden in her private study, magically warded against theft and fire.</p>

        <p>Additionally, she's in possession of a partial map that supposedly shows the location of the dragon's hoard in Giantspire Peak. She's never acted on it, but she keeps it carefully preserved, waiting for the right people to entrust with such knowledge.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Codex - The Shop Cat</h2>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Kumari's Feline Companion</h3>

        <p><strong>Codex</strong> is a large, fluffy ginger cat with white paws and a magnificent plumed tail. He's approximately twelve years old and has been with Kumari since he was a kitten found mewing in a crate of books delivered from a monastery.</p>

        <h4>Personality</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Imperious and dignified, treats The Northern Shelf as his personal domain</li>
            <li>Excellent judge of character—hisses at untrustworthy customers</li>
            <li>Has favorite sleeping spots on different shelves, rotates seasonally</li>
            <li>Allows children to pet him but maintains strict boundaries with adults</li>
            <li>Known to knock books off shelves, but only ones Kumari should reread</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Special Trait</h4>
        <p>Codex seems unnaturally intelligent, even for a cat. Some swear he understands conversations. Kumari insists he's "just perceptive," but there's something uncanny about his amber eyes. <span class="magical-notation">[DM Note: Codex may be a familiar, awakened animal, or simply a very clever cat—choose based on your campaign needs]</span></p>

        <h4>Sample Dialogue</h4>

        <div class="quote">
            <strong>Meeting PCs for the first time:</strong><br>
            "Welcome to The Northern Shelf! I'm Kumari. First time? Wonderful! Every reader's journey begins with a single page. Now, what sort of stories call to you? Adventures? Histories? Or perhaps something more... esoteric?"
        </div>

        <div class="quote">
            <strong>When asked about Giantspire Peak:</strong><br>
            "Ah, the mountain. Yes, I have several texts about it. Dragons, dwarves, and tragedy—all the elements of a grand epic. Though I wonder, are you seeking entertainment, or answers? The price is different for each."
        </div>

        <div class="quote">
            <strong>If PCs are rude or careless with books:</strong><br>
            "Please. These pages have survived longer than kingdoms. Let's show them the respect they deserve, shall we? 'He who damages a book kills reason itself,' or so wrote Richard de Bury in 1344."

        <div class="quote">
            <strong>When revealing something important:</strong><br>
            "I've held this knowledge for many years, waiting for the right people. I believe you might be those people. But remember—'with great knowledge comes great responsibility.' Are you prepared for what you might learn?"

        <h3>Using Kumari in Your Campaign</h3>

        <h4>Role in Fjord's End</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Information broker and quest giver who never leaves her shop</li>
            <li>Provides historical context and foreshadowing through books</li>
            <li>Safe, cozy NPC for downtime and character development</li>
            <li>Bridge between action and research aspects of the campaign</li>
            <li>Can seed rumors, leads, and plot hooks through her inventory</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Balancing Her Knowledge</h4>
        <p>Kumari knows a lot, but information should come at a cost:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gold for rare books or extensive research</li>
            <li>Favors (retrieve a book, protect a shipment)</li>
            <li>Time (research takes days)</li>
            <li>Trust (she won't help those who've proven untrustworthy)</li>
            <li>Sometimes she simply doesn't have the information, no matter how much PCs pay</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Northern Shelf as a Safe Space</h4>
        <p>The bookshop can serve as a sanctuary in the campaign—a place where violence is unthinkable, where enemies might briefly coexist while browsing, where weary adventurers can rest without fear. Kumari's Candle of Inviting reinforces this atmosphere.</p>

        <h4>Advancement Opportunity</h4>
        <p>If a PC shows genuine interest in scholarship, Kumari might take them under her wing, offering training in Arcana, History, or even teaching them spells related to knowledge and books.</p>
