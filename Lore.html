The world around is a sometimes savage, often disorderly and dangerous place -- and Uthmere is anything but (for citizens who abide by the laws and refrain from stupidly goading Lord Uthlain, his lordlain, and the Cudgels).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c12 c26">Footnotes</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">1. Lady Baelma Murove, of the wealthy shipping fleet-owning Moroves of Urmlaspyr, wrote this in 1371 DR, in her chapbook </span><span class="c12">Braving The Cold: Voyages Among the Fallen Stars With My Husband</span><span class="c0">. The tall, slender, long-haired Lady Baelma is a noted &quot;dark beauty&quot; of Sembia, who since the death of her husband has been a much-sought-after heiress. She guards herself with six personal guardian gargoyles (origins unknown) and some mysterious magic items.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">2. These words appear in the chapbook </span><span class="c12">Glimmers of Gold/A Prospectus for Traders of Ambition</span><span class="c0">, by the wealthy trader Horth Blasko of Yhaunn (1369 DR). The chapbook paints glowing pictures of opportunities and possibilities that might benefit those who heed them. Blasko is a fat and jovial man who goes nowhere without hired adventurers as bodyguards, and he is said to have made so many enemies that he sorely needs such protection.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">3. These comments are from the thirty-sixth in the series of broadsheets (sold widely about the Inner Sea coasts) entitled </span><span class="c12">Kisses From Raeraera</span><span class="c13">. Raeraera of Velprintalar travels tirelessly around Inner Sea ports with a small troupe of dancers, performing at clubs and inns rather than rough taverns. The entertainment is explicit, and Raeraera&#39;s Ladies provide more personal entertainments, for high fees, after every public performance. Raeraera is personally notorious for her spectacular natural charms and her drugged &quot;scents of rapture&quot; (said to provide the ultimate in pleasure). She sells love and sleep potions, potions of </span><span class="c12">bear&#39;s endurance</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;and </span><span class="c12">endure elements</span><span class="c0">, and poisons.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">4. &quot;Daelen&quot; is a term meaning &quot;folk of the Great Dale&quot; that&#39;s becoming increasingly popular and widespread in daily use east of the Dragonreach.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">5. &quot;Uthmaar&quot; is the formal term for &quot;citizens of Uthmere.&quot; In daily usage, people dwelling in Uthmere are referred to simply as &quot;Uth&quot; or (by outsiders) &quot;Uth-folk.&quot; The formal term is used with precision by the &quot;lordlain&quot; (&quot;servants of the lord,&quot; or city officials) to mean just citizens, excluding outlanders dwelling in Uthmere either under false pretenses (for example, without declaring that they&#39;ve come from Telflamm or elsewhere as an agent of the Shadowmasters, and/or have skills, a profession, and a name other than the one they&#39;re using in Uthmere) or not &quot;on the Lord&#39;s ledger&quot; (census rolls), and therefore not paying taxes. If a lordlain wants to include such &quot;outlanders&quot; when speaking or writing, the term &quot;people of Uthmere&quot; is used rather than &quot;Uthmaar.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">6. The term &quot;tattercoats&quot; means more than merely &quot;homeless people,&quot; although all beggars are automatically tattercoats (the original meaning of the word was &quot;beggar or habitual lying-in-the-street drunk&quot;). It refers to all &quot;ne&#39;er-do-wells&quot; or undesirables, and it is also a polite way of referring to what a slightly tipsy, and therefore loose-tongued, person of Uth might call &quot;strange critters.&quot; Folk born and bred in Uthmaar tend to mistrust nonhumans, except for halflings, gnomes, and half-elves. They&#39;ll be perfectly polite to elves and dwarves (though such folk are &quot;looked at twice,&quot; or watched), but will be curt with, and even fearful of, races they view as &quot;more exotic.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">7. &quot;Lodging houses&quot; is the local term for rooming houses. Many homeowners in Uthmere rent out one or more floors to lodgers, but the term lodging house is applied only to three- or four-story buildings entirely given over to rooms rented by the month (or by periods of three, four, six, twelve, or fourteen months). Since lodging houses cater to sailors (and caravan merchants and peddlers, who&#39;d accept housing anywhere), they tend to be clustered around the docks. Most offer house guards and secure storage for valuables.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">8. The Cudgels are the everyday name (a term used even by the lordlain and the law enforcement folk themselves; it&#39;s not considered insulting) for Lord Uthlain&#39;s police force, The Watchful Arms of the Lord&#39;s Justice. The Cudgels, whose street patrols are a frequent sight in Uthmere, will be detailed in a later column. They&#39;re sometimes called &quot;the town guard&quot; by housewives, outland scribes , and other careful folk, and &quot;the City Guard&quot; by lordlain.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c26 c12">The next column will introduce the people of Uthmere and explore their buildings, garments, and habits.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c26 c34"></span></p><h1 class="c14" id="h.od9bpvnb1paa"><span class="c20">Uthmere (Part Two)</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c26 c12">By Ed Greenwood</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.2elhzhzfqjnk"><span class="c6">What Smites the Eye in Uthmere</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Most visitors see Uthmere as a tidy city of stone, beset by clinging damp (and nightly fogs) and all the usual smells of a port, but having less noise, stink, and open street refuse than most cities.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Uth streets are cobbled rather than dirt, buildings are of fieldstone, and roofs are of slate or tile. The slate and tile can become deadly missiles in high winds, so they&#39;re inspected often by the Cudgels, who use a wagon akin to a scaffold on wheels; they can levy heavy fines if a roof is found in poor repair, so most &quot;househars&quot; (homeowners) find it cheaper and easier to pay for whatever repair work they claim is necessary, which the Cudgels do on the spot.[</span><span class="c15 c13"><a class="c27" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/lore/uthmere2.shtml%23a1&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1761072633674799&amp;usg=AOvVaw0HYZNxz-FXUIFz0uTQBmzD">1</a></span><span class="c13">] Aside from stables (which have tall lofts used for hay and for rearing clipped-wing pigeons for eggs and as eating-fowl), all buildings in Uthmere rise at least three floors above the street since only shallow cellars are possible.[</span><span class="c15 c13"><a class="c27" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/lore/uthmere2.shtml%23a2&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1761072633675275&amp;usg=AOvVaw0U5gv4tx3_RMhy54JTIkDG">2</a></span><span class="c0">]</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Firefighting is unknown in Uthmere, but thanks to the damp, local building materials, and the lack of &quot;common walls&quot; (buildings that touch must both have unbroken end walls, with no beams or roofs spanning the join), fires that spread beyond a single building are rare.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Uth buildings usually have small, narrow &quot;light-slit&quot; windows at ground level. Higher windows often sport iron-bar gratings to prevent stealthy entry. The gratings are slid into channels on inside walls and pinned there with metal &quot;stops&quot; that pierce a hole in the grating frame and pass on into a cavity bored in the stone of the wall. </span><span class="c12">All</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Uth windows have stout wooden weather shutters.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Balconies are found only on third floors and higher, and they tend to be metal-framed, with wood or metal slats. They&#39;re typically used to grow shragga (leaf lettuce) and other vegetables and herbs, and sometimes to hang wet washing (outside exposure only rarely truly dries anything in Uthmere).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Building roofs tend to be steeply pitched to shed snow and rain, with corner downspouts draining into channels along the sides of streets. (Anyone entering or leaving a building steps between raised doorsill and raised cobbles over a water-run channel.)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The tallest, grandest private buildings in the city (the hightowers of the wealthy) are found in northeasternmost Uthmere, nigh the Lords&#39; Park, in a neighborhood imaginatively called Hightowers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">The prevailing Uth weather is dominated by winds blowing onshore out of the northwest, straight into the mouth of the harbor.[</span><span class="c15 c13"><a class="c27" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/lore/uthmere2.shtml%23a3&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1761072633678039&amp;usg=AOvVaw2L-9emxLfsfp_0wAMeMQrt">3</a></span><span class="c0">]</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Uthmere, the shore around it, and the Dalestream for about the same distance as the width of the city upstream of Uthmere, experience nightly sea mists (fogs). These sea mists cling to the surface of the water and rise up to about 8 feet above it. As a result, the highest parts of the city (Southgate Square and the northern half of Northstream Uthmere) are above the mists, and the rest of the city is shrouded in it.[</span><span class="c15 c13"><a class="c27" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/lore/uthmere2.shtml%23a4&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1761072633678849&amp;usg=AOvVaw2L9p_43AP0roKXJX96Ppc6">4</a></span><span class="c0">]</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Uth-folk habitually drive off damp and chill with fires and with stones and metal &quot;irons&quot; (large blocks of base metal fashioned with handles) that, with the aid of heavy gloves, can be carried to beds and to other rooms of a house.

The cobbles of Uth streets have a smooth side and a rough side, and are turned rough side up when winter freezes start, and back again at full thaw.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Uth-folk dress heavily against the damp, typically wearing leathers or woolens, often with hide breeches and vests. Waist-belts are usual for both genders and are always adorned with pouches, satchels, and small belt knives. (There&#39;s no law against going about armed in Uthmere.) If this makes them too heavy to stay up, diagonal baldrics are worn. Almost everyone wears boots or thick wooden clogs over leggings, and in their homes (and in many city inns and clubs, too) they don slippers to pad about on thick braided rugs laid on the floors for warmth. Many Uth-folk carry stout clubs (that double as walking sticks in times of winter ice, or when infirmity demands) to deal with rats.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">As overgarments, rain-shedding greased or oiled caps and cloaks are common.

It includes the name of the Cudgel levying the fine. Amounts carried on a bloodsheet for more than six months are expunged by seizure of goods, and anyone &quot;under a vaerance&quot; (owing anything) can&#39;t legally leave Uthmere.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">2. Deep cellars do exist, and from time to time they see use as a place to hide the bodies of murder victims or as temporary live storage for edible fish or other seafood, but they&#39;re largely abandoned for the same reason new ones aren&#39;t dug: persistent flooding. Cellars pumped dry tend to be useless for storage or habitation because of slimy molds thriving on the damp stone. &quot;High ground&quot; Uthmere (roughly, the northern half of Northstream Uthmere, and that part of Southstream Uthmere covered by Southgate Square) stands on a thin layer of heavy clay, overlying bedrock. The rest of Uthmere stands on &quot;loose ooze,&quot; which is a variable-depth layer of river silt atop bedrock.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Extensive deep cellars are carved out of solid rock in three places in Uthmere: a granary cellar maintained by the lordlain under Southgate Square for the welfare of the city (foodstuffs to keep Uth-folk alive in the event of famine, siege, or if outside-world trade must be suspended due to plague); the Lord&#39;s private storage cellars (and armory and garrison granary) under the walled compound that contains the Lord&#39;s Palace; and beneath certain private homes and businesses along the northernmost edge of Uthmere.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The entrances to all of these are secret, and it&#39;s an offense punishable by death to cause the construction of any cellar that endangers the stability of an adjacent building or any part of the city walls (including the walls separating the Lord&#39;s compound from the rest of Uthmere), or any cellar or tunnel connecting the city inside the walls to anywhere outside the walls.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">3. This means sailing into the harbor is usually easy, provided one has means for fend-poling (using long spars to push off against the breakwater, to avoid being driven against it).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Leaving again, however (except during the calm that usually comes at nightfall), is often a matter of hard rowing, fend-poling, and &quot;paying the Lord&quot; a stiff 10 gp fee for his oxen. The oxen walk the breakwater trail with their handlers and pull a ship along to the end of the breakwater, where it can be cast free.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">4. The mists occur because the warming of the stone &quot;heat sink&quot; of the city (by fires, other human activities, and sunlight on the stones), added to the warmth of decomposition in the Dalestream-mouth silt, always makes Uthmere warmer than the Easting Reach waters driven onshore by winds.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">5. Thurls are small metal tripod braziers: bowls whose affixed legs hold them about 6 inches off the large, flat safestones they stand on. They are capped with conical metal hoods pierced with a ring of small apertures to let air in and warmth out; perfumed charcoal and small handfuls of kindling (sometimes scented with dried handfuls of fragrant Great Dale grasses) are burned in thurls. Though they&#39;re usually lit only when a room is occupied, every room in the dwelling of well-to-do Uthmaar will have its handy thurl, tinderbox, and supply of &quot;longfingers&quot; (tar-soaked-ended long thorns, straws, or split &quot;fingers&quot; of wood). Large shop rooms and grand chambers will have several, but scented oils or rings of candles are burned in open braziers during feasts and special occasions. Deep inverted cone iron braziers are used, with a floating wick for the oil, or for the candles either a huge central candle, or a ring of smaller ones mounted around the lip of the brazier, so their wax runs down into the central well for later recovery.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">A typical bare brazier of this type costs from 1 to 5 sp depending on size and style (decoration and ornamentation), and thurls likewise run from 2 to 6 sp. Swung as a weapon, a thurl does 1d2 damage (1d2+2 if hot) and a brazier 1d3 (1d3+2 if hot).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c26 c12">Next time, we&#39;ll look at daily -- and nightly -- life in Uthmere.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c26 c30"></span></p><h1 class="c14" id="h.rp7dyxmwbt74"><span class="c20">The Great Dale</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sandwiched between Narfell and Thesk, the Great Dale is considered a vast wilderness by most. The land is speckled with lonely farmsteads and clanholds, guarded by druids and rangers who enjoy their solitude and protect their homes with a vengeance. Few foreigners have reason to journey to the Great Dale, and that&#39;s just how its inhabitants like it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Narfell and Damara bound the Great Dale to the north, Impiltur and the Easting Reach to the west, Thesk to the south, and Rashemen to the east. While a decent road runs the length of the country (if it can be called that) between the Rawlinswood and the Forest of Lethyr, it is not a major trade route. There are few stops along the way, and the residents of the Great Dale show so little hospitality to strangers that a popular joke is &quot;There&#39;s no room in the dale!&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The land here was once part of the ancient Empire of Narfell, although it was originally settled by folk from Jhaamdath. When Narfell and Raumathar destroyed each other 1,500 years ago, the Great Dale was decimated in the fighting and lay virtually empty and wild for centuries. The land is now a frontier for the populous kingdom of Impiltur to the west. For generations, Impilturans in search of land and independence have been trickling eastward, carving out homes from the Dale&#39;s wide-open spaces.</span></p><h2 class="c19 c33" id="h.uswy5kf7kqa5"><span class="c23 c32">Geographic Overview</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Including the great forests that flank the dale itself, the Great Dale extends from the western end of the Rawlinswood to the shores of Lake Ashane, a little more than 400 miles from past to west. North to south, the land runs from the north side of the Rawlinswood down through the Forest of Lethyr to just shy of the River Flam, just over 300 miles. In all this vast territory lives a human population numbering little more than that of a single great city in other lands, and most of that is concentrated at the western end of the dale in Uthmere and the surrounding countryside. There are few settlements in the central or eastern reaches of the Great Dale, and most people in those regions live at least a hard day&#39;s ride from their nearest neighbor.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Most of the land between the forests consists of rolling downs, a seemingly endless series of low, heather-grown ridges steadily climbing as one travels from west to east. The soil is thin and rocky in most spots, and few crops grow well at higher altitudes. Long ago, ancient glaciers gouged this land deeply, leaving behind long, snaking moraines and countless tiny lakes, but scraped the best soil into the low plains near the Easting Reach and the Forest of Lethyr. The folk of the eastern dale are mostly goatherds and shepherds, not farmers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Great Dale&#39;s climate is tempered by the proximity of the Easting Reach, but winters are harsh, while summers are comparatively cool. The Forest of Lethyr is a mix of coniferous and deciduous forest, but the Rawlinswood is a true taiga, a northern pine forest with bitterly cold winters and cool, mosquito-plagued summers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 480.00px;"><img alt="map" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 480.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h2 class="c33 c19" id="h.amgfhti7zkby"><span class="c23 c32">Major Geographic Features</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The two defining features of the Great Dale are the massive forests that bound it to either side. The Rawlinswood runs to the north of the dale from which the land gets its name, and the Forest of Lethyr borders the south. The dale climbs steadily from west to east, reaching an elevation of nearly 2,000 feet above sea level at Ashanath.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.nd12yb8brv9n"><span class="c6">The Dale</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The most prominent feature of the Great Dale is this long, windswept gap between the Forest of Lethyr and the Rawlinswood. When the world was young, some arm of the Great Glacier scoured a path between two slightly higher stretches of land, and since that long-ago time, the great forests have been unable to take root in the vale between. The Dalesfolk tell other stories to explain the gap; some say a great dragon burned a path through one great forest, while others claim that Shaundakul and Silvanus held a contest to determine whether wood or wind would rule this land, and that Auril the Frostmaiden intervened to set winter over both.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Whatever its origin, the gap averages forty to sixty miles in width and stretches nearly 250 miles in length. (The region known as the Great Dale includes the two forests and is quite a bit larger than the dale itself.) Rumpled ridges of bare rock rise from its thin soil, growing steeper and more rugged toward the forests that flank north and south. In sheltered spots, the topsoil is thick and fertile, but most of the land is suited only for raising hardy livestock such as goats and sheep.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Most of the people of the Great Dale live in the western reaches of the land, near Uthmere. As one travels east, settlements become fewer and farther between; most folk live on the edge of the two major forests or just inside their eaves. The canopy of the trees is so thick, even in the heart of winter, that almost no light passes through, casting vast portions of the land in twilight even at the height of the day. While this also provides for shelter from the rains, sun, and snows, it makes for poor farming.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">A long road - the only well-traveled one in the territory - runs from Uthmere all the way to the Cold Road in the east. Technically called the Great Road, it is known by many names throughout the region, but most of the area&#39;s residents just refer to it as &quot;the Road.&quot; Since there aren&#39;t any other major roads, it&#39;s clear which one is meant.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The dale is known for its fierce winter winds. Those farms and settlements not sheltered by the woodlands are scoured by harsh west winds that blow down the length of the gap as if Shaundakul himself were racing along the Great Road.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.79xs6snp80qn"><span class="c23 c10">The Great Barrow</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">About seventy miles up the Great Road from Uthmere looms the Great Barrow, a vast dark mound. A number of lesser barrows ring it like cold sentinels, the long brown grasses of their rounded sides hissing endlessly in a chill north wind that never dies away completely. No one knows who is interred in the Great Barrow, or what forgotten people raised it, but stories say that a cruel human tribe once roamed these lands before even the rise of Narfell, and that their god-born champion lies buried here. Naturally, the place is said to be haunted by restless spirits.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">A century ago, an Impilturan lord named Elphras mocked the old stories and raised a small stone keep on a nearby hill, claiming the barrowfield along with the land for miles about. Some unknown catastrophe overtook Elphras and his entire household, for the Impilturan lord, his family, and a keep full of guards and servants disappeared one cold night, leaving behind an empty and cheerless tower.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.9v530tddp47k"><span class="c23 c10">Val-Murthag</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">North and east of Bezentd lies the wreckage of the old fortress of Val-Murthag, one of the largest Nar ruins not covered by forest. This great castle stood watch over the eastern approaches of the Dale, a formidable rampart in the path of any attack from Raumathar to the east. Val-Murthag was a place of madness and horror, the spiritual center of the demonic cult that dominated the dark empire&#39;s final days, and Raumathari battlemages visited untold destruction on the place in the final battle of the two realms. Little of Val-Murthag remains to be seen, except for sprawling old walls of weathered black stone that run for miles across the cold downs and the shattered stumps of watchtowers amid heaps of battered stone.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The ghosts of Nar demonpriests are said to haunt the ruins, and most of the Dalesfolk give the place a wide berth.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.r2wkhctnkv3c"><span class="c6">Firward Mountains</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">At the northeastern end of the Rawlinswood, hard by Lake Ashane, stand the Firward Mountains. This range lies midway between the Giantspires of Narfell and the northern Sunrise Mountains of Rashemen. The Firwards are unlike the forbidding ranges of the neighboring lands. Relatively low, they are densely forested to their summits and unusually cold and snowy in wintertime. Narfell, Rashemen, and the Great Dale all could claim the Firwards, but the mountains rise between the least populous portions of all three countries, so they form an uncontested border between them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Even in the days of ancient Narfell, the Firwards were not heavily populated, although some of the kingdom&#39;s more powerful archsummoners raised demon-built fortresses in their cold isolation. These days, the Firwards are home to the Horned Skulls (a large, fierce tribe of bugbears), bands of frost giants, and several clans of vicious taers. Beneath their frozen peaks lie the delvings of a handful of shield dwarf clans, and below those, extensive Underdark caverns dominated by demon trolls.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.93atxfo6ye5g"><span class="c6">Forest of Lethyr</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Forest of Lethyr occupies the southern half of the Great Dale and is a natural boundary between that land and Thesk. The portion of the forest south of the River Flam is considered Theskian land. The residents of the Great Dale hardly notice. Thir area has been constantly logged over the years, making it the poor cousin of the northern reaches. Close to the Golden Way, these lands are too near civilization for comfort in the minds of druids and rangers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Forest of Lethyr is home to the Nentyarch (N male human Drdl7/Hie5/Sor6), the most powerful druid in northeastern Faer&ucirc;n. The Nentyarch leads the Circle of Leth and their agents, the Nentyar hunters. From his seat at Yeshelmaar, the Nentyarch and the druids who serve him defend the forest against wanton cutting and over-settlement. The Nentyarch is also the master of the Rawlinswood, but two years ago the frenzied hordes of the Rotting Man stormed Dun-Tharos, his former seat of power, and drove the Circle of Leth to the southern forest. Separated by the sparsely populated valley of the Great Dale, these two opposing forces are engaged in a mortal struggle. for both woodlands.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Forest of Lethyr is filled with all sorts of creatures, but the most prominent ones are the treants who work with their humanoid friends to protect the woods. Lethyr is also home to several villages of secretive wood elves, as well as a handful of volodni bands. Human settlements are limited to the forest&#39;s southern edges. Spearsmouth Dale is nestled on the edges of the treeless valley closest to the source of the Flam. The next valley to the northeast along the forest&#39;s edge is home to Mettledale.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.l57dwjj34xb4"><span class="c23 c10">Fortress Narder</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Like Clymph Tower in the Rawlinswood, this ruin in the Forest of Lethyr is twisted and evil. Some buried taint of ancient Narfell lurks in the dungeons beneath the ivy-grown stones; poisoning the groundwater and sickening the trees and forest creatures of the surrounding area. While it is tempting to blame this baleful influence on the Talontar blightlords of the Rawlinswood, the evil here is different: Its foulness is not Talona&#39;s blight - in fact, the Rotting Man is keenly interested in the mystery of Fortress Narder and sends parties of blightlords here, hoping to unearth something from its horrible dungeons. Under the direction of the Nentyarch, the Circle of Leth is calling treants to move the remaining healthy trees to safer parts of the forest. Then the druids plan to quarantine the area and destroy the corrupted flora and fauna. This will create a hole in the heart of the forest, but in time the wound should heal over. If the druids have anything to say about it, none but they and the Nentyar hunters will know there was anything wrong here.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In the meantime, monstrous creatures spawned in Fortress Narder&#39;s dungeons creep out to hunt and slay in the forest nearby, delaying the druids&#39; plans. The Nentyarch fears that simply quarantining the ruins may not be enough. He may have to find someone to uncover the source of the horrible evil and destroy it once and for all.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.yvqsvy14utlx"><span class="c23 c10">Mauberg&#39;s Oak</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Mauberg&#39;s Oak is a huge tree located in the northwestern reach of the Forest of Lethyr, about a hundred miles southeast of Uthmere. The tree measures 50 feet in diameter at its base and stands over 300 feet tall, towering over the canopy of the forest around it. Its branches shade a vast area, and its leaves are thick and green all year round, even in the dead of the harshest winters.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Although still living, the tree was long ago hollowed out by the powerful druid Mauberg. He magically worked the wood to build a massive tower hideaway in the heart of the amazing tree. Although Mauberg has been dead for over a century, his legacy lives on. He crafted the oak to house a school for young druids and to display the awesome power of nature. The tower features almost a dozen levels on the inside of the tree and extends below the soil for three more levels.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The school&#39;s headmaster, a Theskian woman known as Qakandra (NG female human Drdl3) is wary of strangers, even new applicants. Only those who prove their dedication to nature by passing various tests, both magical and mundane, are allowed to enter the tree itself. Others are permitted to sleep under the eaves of the oak if they are of either good or neutral alignment. Evil visitors are run off immediately.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">A large colony of treants lives under the oak&#39;s canopy. They provide Oakandra with an early warning system against incoming threats. A dozen aarakocras live in the upper branches of the tree, watching the skies for danger from above. The leader of this group, Chir&#39;kawta (NG male aarakocra Drdl2), is a powerful druid who once studied here under Oakandra herself.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.b2crfsob6cxj"><span class="c23 c10">The Mucklestones</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This ancient druidic holy site is located in the northeastern Forest of Lethyr. Its unusual clearing features no tree trunk but is protected from the sky by the bordering trees, which meet over the center of the open space. Within this space stand a number of weathered stones about 6 feet in height, 4 feet across, and 2 feet thick. Their surfaces are covered with nature-runes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The stones form an elaborate arrangement that shifts from time to time, as the stones occasionally move about. Elder druids who have tracked the progression of the Mucklestones over the years claim that sometimes the entire clearing moves, taking the stones along with it. It never moves very far, though, and the druids have always been able to track it down.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Each of the Mucklestones is a portal to a different part of Faer&ucirc;n. The nature-runes on a given stone indicate where it leads, but they are difficult to puzzle out - they are carved in an ancient dialect of the Druidic tongue (Decipher Script check DC 30 or knowledge of the secret language of druids). Some of the runes have faded over the years, miking it impossible to know where the portal might lead.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">At least one of these portals connects to the Sunglade deep in the Yuirwood (see </span><span class="c15 c13"><a class="c27" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/aglarond/index.shtml&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1761072633714201&amp;usg=AOvVaw0IYvpauLwdp-jRewlMf-pZ">Aglarond</a></span><span class="c0">). The druids of this area sometimes use it to meet with the Masters of the Yuirwood, and sometimes they bring along young rangers who wish to study with the foresters of those elder woods.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Mucklestones aren&#39;t the property of any person or group. Still, the Circle of Leth guards the area jealously for fear that evil creatures might locate the stones and destroy them. A high druid named Briartan (LN male human Drd13) lives nearby, and he coordinates the efforts of his fellows to keep the Mucklestones safe. These people sometimes call themselves &quot;the Mucklefriends,&quot; but rarely in the company of strangers.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.6ubssle25uqj"><span class="c23 c10">Yeshelmaar</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Not far from the crossroads of Bezentil, near the center of the Great Dale, a great rocky tor rises from the forest. A pristine lake of clear, cold water stands at its foot. Carved into the tor is an old wood-elf stronghold known as Yeshelmaar, built in the days when the Lethyr elves faced destruction at the hands of the sinister Empire. of Narfell to the north.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The threat of old Narfell has long since passed away, but so too have most of the elven folk. Of the wood elves who once lived here, only a few small villages survive. The old elven stronghold has become the new fortress of the Circle of Leth. The Nentyarch and his High Druids formerly inhabited Dun-Tharos in the Rawlinswood, but two years ago they were driven out by the Talontar blightlords, and Yeshelmaar became the Nentyarch&#39;s seat-in-exile.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Yeshelmaar is the informal capital of the Great Dale, or at least its eastern half. The folk of the lonely clanholds hold a deep reverence for the Nentyarch. At. any given time, a dozen druids of various ranks and twice that number of rangers, hunters, and foresters occupy the stronghold or the woods nearby, along with a handful of Dalesfolk come to seek advice or assistance. The Nentyarch is occupied in a fierce contest against Talona&#39;s Rotting Man for the very soul of two great forests, but his druids do what they can to help out the Dalesfolk and shield them from the worst of the blight- lords&#39; depredations.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.fqtr3llfaawf"><span class="c6">Rawlinswood</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Rawlinswood forms the northern border of the Great Dale, weaving its way south of the Giantspire Mountains and the plains of Narfell until it peters out near the Cold Road and the Firward Mountains. Once, the Rawlinswood was a northern twin to the Forest of Lethyr, but a horrid evil has clawed its way out of the black earth, poisoning the Rawlinswood and filling its green gloom with blood, disease, and madness. The sinister Rotting Man (NE male half-fiend human druid 12/Talontar blightlord 10, Chosen of Talona) leads a dark circle of evil clerics and druids devoted to the Lady of Poison and, through these blightlords, a growing host of blightspawned volodni warriors that menace all the nearby lands.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Rawlinswood is a mixture of deciduous and evergreen trees along its southern border but quickly becomes a soggy taiga as one travels north from the Dale. Treacherous muskeg bogs fester above a deep layer of permafrost, giving rise to clouds of mosquitoes in the Rawlinwsood&#39;s short summer. In its northwestern reaches, the forest climbs sharply toward the Giantspire Mountains, covering rugged foothills and deep, shadowed vales. Like all the Great Dale, it also rises toward the east, and its easternmost reaches are quite hilly. The forest narrows to a narrow band only twenty-five miles wide about two-thirds of the way along its length, moving from west to east. The now-abandoned settlement of Denderdale is located here along the northern edge, almost enclosed by the reaching arms of the forest. This is the best place to try cutting through the forest. The way isn&#39;t long, comparatively, and those who are eloquent or desperate enough may be able to hire a guide to take them to the south side of the forest or back.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Just to the northwest of the forest is the Damaran settlement of Tellerth, hard by the Long Road. For years, the Circle of Leth worked to stop the encroachment of Damaran and Impilturan loggers into the western reaches of the Rawlinswood, but the Nentyarch&#39;s followers have been driven into the Forest of Lethyr and no longer patrol this area. The humans now face the Rotting Man and his rising tide of evil.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.is0ugo8d13b4"><span class="c23 c10">Dun-Tharos</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Once the capital of the ancient Empire of Narfell, Dun-Tharos sprawls for miles through the pines and hogs at the heart of the Rawlinswood. From this place, the Nentyarchs (as the rulers of ancient Narfell were known) ruled a great and terrible realm of dark keeps and proud, sinister lords. Dun-Tharos was laid waste in the final cataclysmic war between Raumathar and Narfell, the entire city leveled by some mighty spell of unspeakable power. So ended the Nentyarchs and their demon-haunted kingdom.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Centuries passed, and the forest grew over the great black scar in its heart. A group of druids and rangers - the Circle of Leth - undertook the work of healing the wounded land, Their leader took the title of Nentyarch anew to signify that the druids of Leth ruled over the heart of ancient Narfell. In the ruins of Dun-Tharos, the new Nentyarchs raised a fortress to govern the great forest. The black keep of the old demonpriests was reborn as a castle of living trees, woven by druidic magic.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">From this forest-castle the Nentyarchs ruled for nearly six hundred years, preserving the Forest of Lethyr and the Rawlinswood from encroachment by human kingdoms on all sides. The ruins of the old Nar capital reminded the druids of humanity&#39;s ability to harm nature, and the forest that had swallowed its black stones offered an example of what might be accomplished with patience and strength.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">All things come to an end, though. Ten years ago, the Rotting Man, Chosen of Talona, began to gather a circle of dark druids in the western reaches of the Rawlinswood. The Circle of Leth fought against the rising power of the blightlords and contained the Rotting Man in the west, but two years ago the Rotting Man created a terrible new weapon to use against the Nentyarch - the blight of Talona. He corrupted a handful of captured Leth druids, changing them into blightlords who serve him. Through these tortured minions, he ensnared hundreds of volodnis and infected them with Talona&#39;s blight. At Midwinter in 1371 DR. he hurled his blightspawned army at the Nentyarch&#39;s fortress and drove the Circle of Leth out of the Rawlinswood.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Dun-Tharos is still a castle of trees, but they are now dead, animated through the Rotting Man&#39;s foul sorcery. Hundreds of his minions lurk in the ruins of Narfell&#39;s old capital, ready to surge forth and slay at his command. His blightspawned warriors slaughtered the small community of Denderdale, north of the forest, only two months ago, and bands of evil volodnis harry the clanholds and farmsteads south of his forest. Dun-Tharos has become a place of death and madness once again.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.2620gwxt5dr6"><span class="c23 c10">Clymph Tower</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Once a proud, walled keep, Clymph Tower has lain in ruins for as long as anyone can remember. A mighty sorcerer named Clymph built the place nearly five hundred years ago. Clymph is also believed to have constructed Tower Threespires, for the two sites have a similar architecture and were built around the same time. Clymph Tower has remained untouched for decades, though, and the locals believe it is cursed for some transgression of its fabled builder against the gods.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">The best story - or at least the one that gets repeated the most - is that Clymph was a powerful demonbinder, a student of the forbidden arts of ancient Narfell. He dreamed of forging a kingdom in the Great Dale with his demonic armies. He constructed this keep as a pen for his foul servants and imbued its very stones with abjurative magic, transforming the perimeter of the building into a massive </span><span class="c12">magic circle</span><span class="c0">. He then created a permanent gate directly into the Abyss. Unfortunately, Clymph was unable to control the demonic hordes he summoned, and his fiendish minions destroyed him. However, he had crafted his demon-trap so well that the fiends could not escape except through one portal leading to Tower Threespires, and that door is sealed. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, of demons are still trapped in the fell tower Clymph raised centuries ago.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Today, those few people who dare to approach the ruins report that its stones glow red with heat and that massive fire crackle from the depths. Even the most daring adventurers give the place a wide berth.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.3f4d68uwi2on"><span class="c23 c10">Tower Threespires</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The legendary Clymph reputedly built this tower as well. Three stone spires stab out of its broad base. It would have fallen over years ago if not for the thick network of vines that wrap around every inch of the place. If the vines were to wither and die, the tower would come down along with them. From a distance, the vine-engulfed tower looks like nothing so much as a giant, three-fingered hand reaching up out of the Rawlinswood.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The tower is maintained by a small group of druids who are the descendants of a special order of guardians created by the Nentyarch hundreds of years ago. The peak of the north tower features a portal that leads right into the heart of Clymph Tower. The druids perform a ritual every Feast of the Moon to keep the portal sealed up tight, preventing the demons trapped therein from escaping into the world. The druids who perform the ritual are no longer certain if the legends about the demons of Clymph Tower are true, but they hold to their appointed task.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The druids of Tower Threespires are suspicious of strangers. They never allow anyone into the tower, no matter how dire the need, for fear of opening the portal and unleashing the demons of the Abyss on the Great Dale.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.hyehw3iy9gqc"><span class="c23 c10">Nighthawk Tower</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Brave souls who skirt the Narfell edge of the Rawlinswood on their way east and south toward more welcoming lands eventually come to Nighthawk Tower. City dwellers may not immediately recognize it, since it&#39;s actually a mighty oak tree - about 100 feet tall - the branches of which are filled with platforms constructed with sturdy rope and rough-hewn wood.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Nighthawk Tower is the home of Hensoi (NG male human Drd12 of Silvanus), who has a reputation - deserved or not - as the friendliest druid in the Great Dale. In other words, he doesn&#39;t hide at the first sight of other people, nor does he run off visitors before they&#39;ve had a chance to speak. Hensoi is fond of the region&#39;s birds, and at times the boughs of Nighthawk Tower seem like a giant aviary. The local raptors often rest here.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Hensoi isn&#39;t outgoing, but he is willing to talk to strangers, which is more than most druids in the area do. Underneath his gruff exterior, he&#39;s softhearted. When presented with good people who need his help, he grudgingly agrees to do what h can, although he complains about it the entire time.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">When confronted with evil, Hensoi sends his avian friends high into the sky to screech for help. The druids and rangers in the region recognize the signal, and when they see it, they dash for the tower to offer their help. The locals may think Hensoi a bit too free with strangers, but he&#39;s one of them, and they won&#39;t let him come to harm.</span></p><h1 class="c14" id="h.lwmcm7cegvbx"><span class="c20">Cities and Sites of the Great Dales</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Great Dale boasts only one city of any size: Uthmere.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Every other settlement is a tiny hold or thorp, usually home to fewer than twenty people. Most of these tiny communities huddle along the Great Road, including Bezentil and Kront, the only other settlements that might even be called towns. For most people of the Great Dale, these towns are a necessary evil, if only because their presence along the road keeps strangers from wandering into the woods.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.2mqa9usi0twr"><span class="c6">Bezentil (Hamlet)</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Bezentil is the only real community between the Great Road&#39;s western and eastern ends, and the only town worthy of the name for at least a hundred miles in any direction. Here a series of ten dwarf-high stones are spaced along the road in 10-foot intervals. The site has been used as a meeting place for untold years, but the settlement itself is relatively new. As recently as forty years ago, no buildings stood here, and no one lived within a dozen miles of the spot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The sole industry in Bezentil is trading with people passing through on the Road. Caravans commonly use the place as a waymeet. The locals bring out locally made or grown goods such, as fine wooden items, rare herbs, produce, pelts, and leather goods, bartering for manufactured items such as tools and weapons. The people of the Great Dale are wonderful foresters and farmers, but they lack skill in mining and working metals.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.cgol3m8abz2a"><span class="c23 c10">The Markers</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The stone markers along the Road radiate a lingering aura of conjuration magic almost all year long. At the exact moment of both the spring and autumn equinoxes, the powerful spells with which they are imbued suddenly leap to life. Anyone who moves along the road at this time and touches all ten markers in sequence is instantly transported with his belongings to an identical set of markers in far-off Kara-Tur.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Great Road was once the main route for transport between Faer&ucirc;n and the lands to the east, but this was long ago, back when elves were the only humanoids who lived in the Great Dale. The only evidence that elves were ever here includes a handful of ancient ruins scattered throughout the territory - and these markers on the road.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Circle of Leth guard this secret carefully. If word of the markers&#39; true nature gets out, the Great Road would once again become a main artery of traffic moving between Kara-Tur and the rest of Faer&ucirc;n. The druids cherish their solitude, and they will go to great lengths to ensure that it is not broken by twenty times the current number of merchant caravans.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Merchants, of course, would pay dearly for such information. Such a mysterious but useful portal would open up new trade with the east, without anyone having to brave the hazards of the Endless Wastes.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.2oso3yybj1dl"><span class="c23 c10">Major Businesses</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Only a handful of businesses flourish in Bezentil. Their proprietors are the friendliest, most open-minded people east of Uthmere. The largest building is Strick&#39;s Trading Post, a general store run by Abrihando Strick (LE male human Com6) and his wife Gennia (LN female human Com 3). Travelers can buy and sell most mundane items worth 25 gp or less here, although Strick&#39;s prices are double normal. He&#39;s literally the only shop for hundreds of miles around, and he knows it. Mimor Katan (NG male human Com4) and his family run the Windblown Goat, a small inn and tap house. Katan&#39;s rooms are charitably described as &quot;rustic,&quot; but he has a half-dozen available at a reasonable rate, and on a winter night, a dirt-floored room with a fire is much more comfortable than a blanket on a frigid hillside. Katan&#39;s kitchen serves a hearty meal and excellent homemade ale, but the specialty of the house is a precious liquor known as goldenleaf.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Last year, a livery stable opened up not far from the Windblown Goat. Weary travelers can rest their mounts and have them groomed and fed for a few silver pieces each. Cassilla Fen (NG female human Exp7), the owner, is also a skilled cartwright, capable of repairing all but the most damaged wagons. She has been a godsend to the caravans passing this way, the more so because her prices are reasonable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Bezentil (Hamlet)</span><span class="c0">: Conventional; AL LN; 100 gp limit; Assets 620 gp; Population 124; Isolated (human 96%, half-elf 3%, elf 1%).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Authority Figures</span><span class="c0">: Kassantra, Mufdan, LN female human Ari6 (head of the village council).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Important Characters</span><span class="c0">: Sheriff Trag Finstek, N male human War9 (the only full-time law enforcer in town); Cassilla Fen, NG female human Exp7 (owner of the town stable); Abrihando Strick, LE male human Com6 (proprietor of the only store).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Militia</span><span class="c0">: War6, War5, War4 (2), War3 (2); Other Characters.

Its Dalesfolk formerly traded with those Nar tribes inclined to deal with outsiders and maintained a wary truce with the rest. But two months ago, on a cold night in early Marpenoth, a trio of powerful blightlords led a company of blightspawned volodni warriors out of the surrounding forests and razed the village. Of the settlement&#39;s four hundred people, only a few dozen escaped with their lives. It&#39;s whispered that many of the slain have been reanimated as undead troops in the Rotting Man&#39;s army.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.kjqe9yz2mw4o"><span class="c6">Evrelthed&#39;s Hill</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">About four days&#39; travel east of Uthmere and half a day&#39;s walk from the Great Road stands the farmstead of Evrelthed. Northol (LG male human Ftr2/Exp 3). Evrelthed, his wife, their four sons, his brother, and his brother&#39;s family live here, a tiny settlement of eleven people huddled in a sheltered dell miles from their nearest neighbors, Such farmsteads are scattered like a half-handful of seed corn across the broad expanse of the Dale. Unlike more settled areas, where, most parcels of arable ground belong to somebody, the Great Dale has wide stretches of unclaimed land that anyone can claim, as long as they&#39;re willing to put up with bitter weather, dangerous monsters, and a lot of loneliness.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Evrelthed is a thin, sour man of about forty who has steadily refined the art of complaining about his land and his fortunes for decades. He and his family are willing to put up travelers who don&#39;t mind sleeping in a fieldstone cellar cut into the side of a hill a hundred yards from the farmsteaders&#39; home. The accommodations may be humble, but Evrelthed&#39;s wife Kalina (LG female human Com3) serves the heartiest supper for a hundred miles.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.nq9q53974yre"><span class="c6">Kront (Hamlet)</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Kront is a tiny outpost where the Great Road meets the Cold Road and the road to Tammar. This is the most well-traveled crossroads in the region, and most of the Dalesfolk disavow it for that reason, claiming the place more properly belongs to Thesk. Thesk, Rashemen, and Narfell all refuse to lay claim to the place, though, so it&#39;s part of the Great Dale by default.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Kront is a neutral trading ground for the surrounding lands. The merchants who regularly pass through here appreciate the lack of politics, especially since this translates into no direct taxes or tolls. The people.of Kront make their living trading goods and services with travelers. Kront concentrates on providing services to traders, but it&#39;s also a key point for folk from hundreds of miles around to purchase tools and other items they cannot fashion on their own. Many merchants who start out thinking of Kront as a rest stop on their way to other points have decided this is a fine place to trade as well. In particular, fisherfolk come here every day to hawk their catches from Lake Ashane, providing fresh fish for those staying in Kront and smoked meat for them to take on their way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Kront (Hamlet)</span><span class="c0">: Conventional; AL N; 100 gp limit; Assets 1,335 gp; Population 267; Isolated (human 96%, half-elf 3%, elf 1%)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Authority Figures</span><span class="c0">: Lord Chinilvur, N male human Ari8 (descendant of an Impilturan noble who obtained a title over the nearby land and the richest man in Kront).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Important Characters</span><span class="c0">: Durtentan Palander NG male human Rgr11 (leader of the local rangers); Xander Capstal, NG male human War5 (captain of the militia).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Town Guard</span><span class="c0">: War4, War2 (3), War (7); Militia: War6, War5 (2), War4 (7), War3 (3); Other Characters: Bbn3; Brd2; Clr5, Clr2; Drd9, Drd6, Drd3; Ftr3, Ftr1; Rgr7, RgrS, Rgr4, Rgr3, Rgr2, Rgr1 (2); Rog5, Rog1; Sor3; Wiz4; Ari6, Ari2 (2), Ari1 (2); Exp7, Exp6, Exp5, Exp4 (4), Exp3 (6), Exp2 (9), Exp1 (16); War3 (2), War2 (5), War1 (11); Com6 (2), Com5 (2), Com4 (3), Com3 (8), Com2 (22), Com1 (133).</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.an3vu9he78g3"><span class="c6">Mavalgard</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Home to Clan Maval, a sturdy family of hardscrabble farmers and herders, Mavalgard is typical of the dozen or so isolated clanholds in the central and eastern reaches of the Great Dale. Fiercely independent and stubbornly self-reliant, the Mavals caine to this land from Impiltur almost two hundred years ago, determined to carve out a life of their own from the barren wilderness. Today, the hold is home to an extended family of perhaps fifty souls under the rule of Angheder Maval (CG male human Ftr4/Ari3), a short-tempered old curmudgeon who is far wiser than he lets on.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Mavalgard is a rough motte-and-bailey keep with a field-stone tower and a ramshackle wooden palisade. It is surrounded by several rude homes of fieldstone and thatch burrowed snugly into the steep hillsides to avoid the worst of the winter winds. The Mavals maintain friendly relations with several other clanholds within a day&#39;s journey or so, and the folk of these holds gather three or four times a year to drink, trade, decide matters of justice, and arrange marriages.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.e4md4w4g54nc"><span class="c6">Mettledale and Spearsmouth Dale</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Along the southern border of the Forest of Lethyr lie two small settlements that are part of the Great Dale, of Thesk, or neither, depending on whom you happen to ask. Spearsmouth Dale is a little more than fifty miles north of Phsant in a narrow vale that arrows another twenty miles or so into the forest. Lord Abraer Thellblade (CG male human Ftr8), a former adventurer, watches over the sleepy Village from a keep he and his companions cleared of vampires several years ago. Its people consider themselves Dalesfolk, but Lord Abraer obtained his writ to govern the land from the ruling council of Phsant. This doesn&#39;t trouble the locals, who know that Abraer saved them from death or worse by destroying the vampire lord of the keep.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Mettledale is in a larger vale just north and east of Spearsmouth Dale. Several small villages dot this fertile valley, all under the rule of an arrogant wizard-lord named Vosthor (NE male hagspawn Wiz11). The dale has traditionally been ruled by the most powerful wizard in residence, and Vosthor - a wandering troublemaker and tomb-plunderer - unseated the previous ruler two years ago upon learning of the tradition. A brutal gang of brigands and thugs backs up the hagspawn, serving as his &quot;constables&quot; and &quot;tax collectors.&quot; The folk of Mettledale are too intimidated to move directly against their wizardly master, but they are growing desperate to get rid of the predacious Vosthor.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.iek68l3a3arm"><span class="c6">Uthmere (Small City)</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Built where the Dalestream meets the Easting Reach, Uthmere is easily the largest settlement in all the Great Dale. The river is shallow and not navigable but a stone breakwater protects a small but bustling harbor. Of course, the people of the wilds don&#39;t consider the &quot;big city&quot; part of their homeland at all. Similarly, the residents of Uthmere have little attachment to the rest of the country. As the saying goes among the people of the Great Dale, &quot;It&#39;s a long way from Uthmere to Kront.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Most of Uthmere&#39;s inhabitants hail from Impiltur, Damara, and Thesk. For centuries, various Impilturan lords have ruled the city - some, exiles who fled an enemy at court; others, crusaders who dreamed of taming the wilderness to the east and bringing Impilturan law and culture to the benighted Dalesfolk. Although Uthmere is nominally independent of Impiltur, the lordship of the city remains an Impilturan title.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">As one might expect, the interests of Uthmere don&#39;t always coincide with those of the rest of the Great Dale. The current ruler, Lord Uthlain (NG male human Ari12), hopes to see his small city become a major hub of commerce in the region, but the druids and rangers who live along the Great Road have confounded his efforts. The Circle of Leth does not concern itself with homesteaders claiming empty lands in the open dale, but entrepreneurs hoping to rake furs, timber, and other riches from the forests find the druids quick to discourage all but the least intrusive of such activities.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 370.67px;"><img alt="map" src="images/image7.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 370.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.imv9cjue3en"><span class="c23 c10">Lord&#39;s Palace</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Lord Uthlain lives in a gray stone palace above the harbor. He maintains his power through a decades-old alliance his family made long ago with a band of seven stone giants. These massive creatures are Uthlain&#39;s muscle in the small city, and they supplement and reinforce the town guard.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The stone giants have sworn an oath of fealty to Uthlain&#39;s family, a duty that they take seriously. They are compensated well for their efforts and actually live on the first floor of the Lord&#39;s Palace. Nearly everything at this level is built for both joint human and stone giant use. The ceilings are 20 feet high, but a railed balcony runs along every room at the floor, raising those standing on them to eye level with the giants who share the place.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.c2supv9pmpd1"><span class="c23 c10">Notable Businesses</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The city boasts a number of excellent inns, mostly catering to seafarers who wish to spend a night on solid ground for a change. At the top end of the scale, the Captain&#39;s Loft offers luxurious accommodations. Its prices (roughly triple normal) ensure that only the &quot;proper&quot; class of people stay there. Only the captains of the largest and most successful ships can afford it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Toward the bottom of the barrel, there is the legendary dive known as the Bloody Hook. This seedy hole in the wall serves hard drinks to hard people, and at the end of the night, the scullery maid often mops up as much spilled blood as beer. For adventurers looking for action, though, this is the place.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.4550t47gn9ng"><span class="c23 c10">Major Temples</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Most of the major good and neutral deities are represented in Uthmere. The Hall of Brilliant Justice is a large, fortified temple to Tyr under the High Master of the Just, Blostin Marsk (LG male human Clr10 of Tyr). The hidden House of the Master&#39;s Shadow, a temple dedicated to Mask, lurks in the worst part of town. The Shadowmasters of Telflamm venerate Mask, and as they extend their tendrils deeper and deeper into the commerce of the nearby cities, they bring the worship of their nefarious deity with them. The Shadowmasters have gained a secure foothold in Uthmere, and they intend to bring the entire city under their dark dominion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Uthmere (Small City)</span><span class="c0">: Conventional/nonstandard; AL NG/CE; 15,000 gp limit; Assets 6,615,000 gp; Population 8,820; Mixed (human 82%, half-elf 7%, elf 4%, halfling 3%, dwarf 2%, gnome 1%, half-orc 1%).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Authority Figures</span><span class="c0">: Lord Uthlain, NG male human Ari12 (ruler of the city); Master Tintel Farpadden, CN male halfling Rog11 (local leader of the Shadowmasters).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">Important Characters</span><span class="c0">: Captain Enda Quellinghanter, NG female fire genasi Ftr13 (captain of the guard).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">City Guard</span><span class="c0">: War11, Ftr9, War9, War8, Ftr7, Pal7, War5 (2), War4 (6), Ftr3 (3), War3 (8), Ftr2 (4), War2 (38), Ftr1 (6), War1 (142); Militia: War5, War4 (2), War3 (8), Com3 (2), War2 (37), Com2 (7), War1 (102), Com1 (91); Other Characters: Bbn10, Bbn8, Bbn6, Bbn5, Bbn4 (2), Bbn3 (3), Bbn2 (5), Bbn1 (15); Brd8, Brd7, Brd5 (2), Brd4 (2), Brd3 (2), Brd2 (4), Brd1 (10); Clr11, Clr7, Clr6, Clr5, Clr4 (3), Clr3 (3), Clr2 (4), Clr1 (8); Drd9, Drd8, Drd6, DrdS, Drd4 (2), Drd3 (4), Drd2 (6), Drd1 (14); Ftr7, Ftr6, FtrS (2), Ftr4, Ftr3, Ftr2 (2), Ftr1 (8); Mnk9, Mnk8, Mnk6, Mnk5, Mnk4 (2), Mnk3 (3), Mnk2 (6), Mnk1 (7); Pal7, Pal5, Pal4, Pal3 (2), Pal2, Pal1 (7); Rgr9, Rgr8, Rgr5, Rgr4 (3), Rgr3 (4), Rgr2 (7), Rgn1 (13); Rog9, Rog8, Rog5, Rog4 (2), Rog3 (4), Rog2 (8), Rog1 (12); Sor11, Sor8, Sor5 (2), Sor4 (2), Sor3 (4), Sor2 (5), Sor1 (15); Wiz11, Wiz7 (2), Wiz6, Wiz5, Wiz4 (2), Wiz3 (2), Wiz2 (9), Wiz1 (14); Adp11, Adp9, Adp6, Adp5, Adp4 (2), Adp3 (4), Adp2 (7), Adp1 (29); Ari8, Ari5 (3), Ari4 (2), Ari3 (3), Ari2 (7), Ari1 (39); Exp11, Exp9, Exp6, Exp5 (2), Exp4 (3), Exp3 (7), Exp2 (21), Exp1 (231); War7, War5 (2), War4 (2), War3 (5), War2 (14), War (59); Com15, Com10, Com7 (2), Com5 (3), Com4 (3), Com3 (34); Com2 (166), Com1 (7,414).</span></p><h2 class="c33 c19" id="h.4p984dq5thei"><span class="c23 c32">Heroes and Monsters</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Most characters from the Great Dale are humans, wood elves, half-elves, or volodnis.

Its borders are defined by its neighbors and the will of the Circle of Leth to protect its forests. There is no national government, and the people like it that way. Two people could claim to rule the Great Dale, were they so inclined: Lord Uthlain of Uthmere and the Nentyarch:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Uthlain has enough trouble governing his small city, especially now that the Shadowmasters have moved into town. Even if he tried to extend his influence outward from the city, the people of the open lands would simply laugh at him. Some of Uthlain&#39;s advisors entertain the notion of subjugating the rest of the dale through military might, but the Lord of Uthmere wants no part of such aggression. He knows the homesteaders and clansfolk would appeal to the Nentyarch, and the land would erupt in a civil war. While Lord Uthlain may have many ambitions for UthMere - and, by extension, the rest of the Great Dale - he has no desire to water the forests with blood.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Nentyarch already leads all the folk he cares to govern through the Circle of Leth and harbors no desires to become a druid-king. He is already in charge in the ways that matter, and he is happy to avoid the politicking and headaches that come with overt rule.</span></p><h2 class="c33 c19" id="h.37xl46ilnhro"><span class="c23 c32">History of the Great Dale</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Great Dale has been mostly undisturbed since its lands fell out from under the control of ancient Narfell.

The first ruler of the city was its founder, Lord Uthmere, a wealthy Dilpuran sea captain who believed he had discovered the perfect gateway to eastern Faer&ucirc;n. He began the construction of the Great Road along the center of the Great Dale, and it was completed during his grandson&#39;s reign.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sadly, Lord Uthmere&#39;s plans for transforming his town into the jewel of the Easting Reach never materialized. Each of the lords who followed has tried to breathe life into that dream, but none have had much success. This is partly because the rest of the country doesn&#39;t really want this to happen, but it&#39;s mostly because Uthmere&#39;s main competitor as the gateway to the east is Telflamm, a city notoriously corrupted by the Shadowmasters headquartered there.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Great Dale itself has no government. The closest the lands outside of Uthmere come a ruler is the Nentyarch, the leader of the Circle of Leth. The Nentyarch earned his position by becoming the most powerful and respected druid in the region. He plans to hold this place of honor until another druid surpasses him, he retires, or he dies.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In the open lands of the Dale, politics - such as they are - work like this: The Nentyarch tells the druids what to do; the druids advise the clanlords and the leaders of homesteads, and those individuals run their lands as they choose. The leader of a small clan is hardly an autocrat or a tyrant; he might be the king of his hold, but one who rules with the consent of his kinsfolk. The Nentyar rangers or Leth druids often serve as impartial arbiters when neighboring clan-chiefs can&#39;t come to an agreement about matters of mutual concern.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.lwp9jh92u6rd"><span class="c6">Enemies</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Despite the Great Dale&#39;s lack of traditional riches and the fact that it is mostly untamed wilderness, a number of factions harbor ill intentions toward the Dalesfolk and their druidic protectors.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.2rmra32l683"><span class="c23 c10">The Qu&#39;engesta</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Qu&#39;encesta are members of one of the most violent tribes in all Narfell. Eager for plunder and slaughter, they have launched attack after attack against their kinfolk over the years, and every time, they have been crushed by the combined might of the other tribes. Recently, they have decided to switch targets and have turned their collective eye on the Great Dale.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Under the guidance of Warleader Heara (CE female human Bbn11/Rog2), the Qu&#39;encesta have been slowly massing for war. Their activity has not gone unnoticed by the Dag Nost tribe, who live in the southern plains of Narfell. The Dag Nost are not the target of the impending Qu&#39;encesta raid, though - the folk of the Great Dale are. Warleader Heara plans to strike south, cutting straight though the narrowest part of the Rawlinswood to break out into open ground near Bezentil.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In the path of the savage Qu&#39;encesta stand the blightspawned armies of the Rotting Man. Heara and her warriors know little of the Talontar blightlords, as the tribesfolk normally do not come so far south. Similarly, the blightlords pay little attention to the barbarians of the plains north of the Rawlinswood. Most likely, the blightlords will meet the drive of the Qu&#39;encesta invasion with their own army - unless the Rotting Man chooses to stand aside and allow the Qu&#39;encesta to pass through his forest or, worse yet, makes an alliance with the bloodthirsty barbarians.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.y94kohdmexvq"><span class="c23 c10">Demons From Ancient Days</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The rulers of ancient Narfell forged their empire, not with statesmanship and diplomatic skill, but through pacts with demons who agreed to serve them. Despite the power of their foul allies, the rulers of Narfell came to a bad end. While they were being wiped out, many of their demonic servants vanished into the deepest, darkest parts of the forest. Some of these, fiends concealed themselves for centuries, slumbering away the years while they waited for great Narfell to rise again.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But many of the creatures were unable to awaken from their deathless slumber. Beneath the Rawlinswood and the darker portions of the Forest of Lethyr, these ancient demons still lie buried despite the passage of fifteen centuries.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Every now and then, some curious fortune-hunter runs across an old ruin, and while poking around for treasure, disturbs a sleeping demon. The Nentyarch is aware of the potential problems, but he prefers not to risk awakening the creatures. Some of the fell powers sleeping beneath the forests are so strong and wicked that not even the Nentyarch himself could hope to imprison them again.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Nentyar hunters keep an eye on such places to ensure that no strangers get near them, but their bitter contest with the Talontar blightlords and the impending raid of the Qu&#39;encesta may make such vigilance difficult. While the Circle of Leth has its hands full, the invaders are likely to discover and let loose a few demons.</span></p><h1 class="c14" id="h.w3zi0pg7ipbv"><span class="c20">People of the Great Dale</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The people of the Great Dale are honest, hardworking folk who simply want the outside world to leave them alone. For the most part, they&#39;ve gotten their wish, since few people see much reason to travel here. If it were not for the Great Road connecting Uthmere to the east, there would not be any traffic through the region at all.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The people of the Great Dale are a mix of old Chondathan, Nar, Theskian, and more recently, Impilturan blood. The clan-holds possess the oldest bloodlines of the land, with more than a little of the ancient Nars. The folk of the Great Dale place little importance on race or ethnicity - a good neighbor is a good neighbor. The older families do not always get along with Impilturan homesteaders pushing eastward from Uthmere, who see miles of empty land and believe they&#39;re free to settle where they wish. This has led to bloodshed, but for the most part, the Impilturan colonists have found land that doesn&#39;t encroach on the holds of the earlier Dalesfolk.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The people of the Great Dale dress simply and for the weather. They favor homespun linen fabrics in the summer and leathers and furs in the winters. Although sunlight barely reaches the floor of the great forests, the ground underneath them is well protected. The canopy of these elder woods is a blanket in the winter, a shade in the summer, and an umbrella when the rains come.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.syxtbfijsl1t"><span class="c6">Races and Cultures</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Once wild elves, wood elves, volodnis, and perhaps other races populated the Great Dale. Few traces of their presence remain in the land between the forests; since ancient times, this has been a human land. Settlers fleeing the destruction of ancient Jhaamdath moved into the area over sixteen centuries ago only to end up under the crushing boot of the Empire of Narfell. When that realm was destroyed in its war against Raumathar, the residents of the Great Dale were suddenly ungoverned and independent. They have avoided foreign rule ever since. The people of the Great Dale are almost exclusively human. The only exceptions, other than the odd wanderers are the few non-humans who have settled in Uthmere, the only place in the region that can lay claim to the label &quot;civilized.&quot; In the wild eastern part of the Dale, that word is synonymous with &quot;worthless&quot; and &quot;weak,&quot; carrying overtones of conniving and deceit. Using it usually leads to an all-out brawl.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">While the Dalesfolk don&#39;t like outlanders at all, they don&#39;t care much for one another, either. The forests and fields are dotted with tiny enclaves of isolated clans. The common tongue here is Damaran, a legacy of ancient Narfell, but the Nar heritage of the Great Dale is long forgotten. The &quot;old&quot; Dalesfolk are descended from Chondathans who came to this land more than a thousand years ago, while the &quot;new&quot; are generally Impilturans who have settled the western reaches of the Dale for several hundred years. The Circle of Leth is the only unifying force in the region. If it were not for the druidic hierarchy, the two cultures sharing the Great Dale would be at each other&#39;s throats.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.dewe3lkt5cch"><span class="c6">Life and Society</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Outside the port city of Uthmere, three different kinds of people inhabit the Dale: farmers, herders, and the druids and rangers. Most of the farmers live under the trees in the western portions of the Dale and are often of Impilturan descent. They grow crops of all sorts but prefer hardier grains such as wheat and corn that can stand up to windswept springs and early frosts. The farmers usually end up with plenty for themselves and enough left over to barter with traveling merchants or their neighbors for things they can&#39;t grow or make on their own. Most Great Dale farms are homesteads of one or two families.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The herders keep their flocks in the open stretches of the central and eastern Dale. Their homes are often made of field-stone fitted together by hand and chinked with mud, half-buried in a hillside to stay below the winter winds. These goatherds and shepherds are more likely to be &quot;old&quot; Dalesfolk and gather in clanholds of five to ten related families.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The rangers and druids patrol the forests, keeping out strangers and protecting their beloved woods. They warn off wayward souls who wander into something they know nothing about. People who are out to maliciously harm the forests, however, receive the harshest treatment. The rangers of the Great Dale save their greatest fury for those fools who attempt to set up logging operations within their domain. Both rangers and druids prefer to sleep under the sheltering canopy of the Rawlinswood or the Forest of Lethyr. When traveling, they may spend a night or two under the stars, but they prefer to minimize their time in the open. These followers of the Nentyarch hunt and gather their own food. They sometimes call on the farmers of the land to contribute food or shelter, but they prefer not to trouble the Dalesfolk.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.6gwpsbmy54m"><span class="c23 c10">Economy</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Uthmere has the only real economy in the Great Dale. Its lord mints coins that are used throughout the city but rarely beyond. The people of the wilds prefer barter to money. As the locals like to say, &quot;Coins are too easy to lose.&quot; Uthmere makes most of its money on mooring fees charged to merchants who rise its harbor. In effect, this is a toll for the Great Road, as the only easy way to get to it from the coast is directly through Uthmere.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The people of the wild lands produce herbs, alchemical ingredients, and wooden goods of the highest quality. The Great Dale has no mines within its borders, and the only forges are in Uthmere, Bezentil, and Kront. With the exception of simple iron items such as horseshoes or nails, the Dalesfolk must import metal items and tools.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.pvcgjg3pxzcy"><span class="c23 c10">Law and Order</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Uthmere is governed by an old code based on the laws of the Impilturan crown. The city guards are empowered to enforce the law; there is no separate town watch. An appointed magistrate hears most cases, although Lord Uthlain himself presides over issues of serious crimes. Uthmere is a haven for smugglers who ferry contraband into Impiltur across the Easting Reach, and the Shadowmasters of Telflamm are eager to bring this illicit trade under their control.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In the countryside, the Great Dale is almost lawless. While most folk don&#39;t steal from or injure their neighbors, they expect only what justice they can carve out with a blade. Many people do not venture away from their homes unless armed, even if only with a quarterstaff or a club, but a well-worn longsword or longbow is preferred by travelers in the wilder reaches. Bandits and marauders are not very common, but the lands of the Great Dale are filled with wild animals and monsters. Only a &quot;civilized&quot; person would even consider walking around without a weapon at his side.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Outside of Uthmere&#39;s walls, justice is either swift or left undone. Wrongdoers who are caught are punished on the spot by their captors. The favored method of execution is to bind criminals high in the branches of a tree, where they either die of thirst or are eaten by animals. It&#39;s not unusual to see sun-bleached, picked-over skeletons hanging in the trees along the perimeter of either forest. These are an object warning to those who would intrude on the peace of these woods.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.6zqz7qstvpsl"><span class="c23 c10">Defense and Warcraft</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">No one has tried to invade the Great Dale in centuries. The Great Road could be a path of Thayan aggression against lands farther west, but the Great Dale is hundreds of miles from Thay, and even the Red Wizards would have difficulty sustaining an army so far from home. Even if invaders were to attack the Dale, most of its people would let them pass unmolested, as long as their armies stuck to the Great Road. Any troops who entered the woods, however, would have to contend with the full fury of the Nentyarch and the Circle of Leth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">It&#39;s hard to imagine why another nation would want to conquer the Great Dale other than out of some kind of mad land-lust. The riches of the land lie almost exclusively within its mighty forests, and the danger involved in extracting them would be ridiculously high. It is simpler, safer, and far cheaper to barter with the locals - and that&#39;s just what most of the Great Dale&#39;s neighbors have done over the years.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The rise of the Rotting Man and his blightlords in the black hold of Dun-Tharos has finally brought a real threat to the Great Dale. The blightlords command an army of blight-spawned treants, volodnis, and animals, a slavering horde strong enough to overwhelm everything east of Uthmere. Only the vigilance of the Circle of Leth holds them in check, and the Circle may not be able to contain the Talontar blightlords for much longer.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Dalesfolk have seen enough of the blight to understand that their homes&#39; and lives are endangered by the fell power in the northern woods. For the first time in living memory, the clanlords of the eastern Dale are making ready for war. Nentyar hunters carry messages from hold to hold and farm to farm. No one hold can muster more than a dozen or so militia, but the druids hope a call to arms from the Nentyarch will bring fighting men and women from a hundred such settlements. Only an immediate and dire threat could bring the Dalesfolk to forget distance and differences, and the Rotting Man&#39;s feral army poses exactly such a threat. Led by the Circle of Leth, Dalesfolk under arms may be surprisingly determined soldiers.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.jibx9hf2c8t9"><span class="c23 c10">Religion</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The citizens of Uthmere venerate most deities of the Faer&ucirc;nian pantheon. Even so, the most popular gods here are those who are worshiped throughout the Dale: Chauntea, Eldath, Mielikki, and Silvanus (although Tyr&#39;s faith is also wide-spread). Of these, Eldath garners the most worship in Uthmere because of her association with the waters that tumble out of the forest and into the sea. The secret House of the Master&#39;s Shadow (recently founded in an anonymous building in the city&#39;s poorest quarter) is the local branch of the Shadowmasters. The Shadowmasters have already started their standard tactic of recruiting from the youngest and poorest inhabitants, and they have had a lot of success so far. Mask is pleased.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Chauntea, Mielikki, and Silvanus are worshiped widely in the rest of the territory. The people of the Great Dale understand that while they may seem alone, they are always surrounded by their chosen deities - nature gods all. The farmers who work the open fields favor Chauntea. Silvanus appeals to most of the druids and rangers, although Mielikki comes in a close second. Women are especially fond of her, and when a person of the Great Dale is in need, they appeal to her kinder nature first. People who live along the Great Imphras River or near the headwaters of the Easting Reach often prefer Eldath.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.ea9eqa9c4um2"><span class="c6">Adventurers</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">When most adventurers look at a map of Faer&ucirc;n, they pass over the Great Dale without a second thought. The reputation of the Nentyarch and his followers is well known, as well as the fact that the forests they protect are perilous to intruders. Still, there are plenty of opportunities for adventure in the Great Dale: elven ruins to explore, rampaging monsters to defeat, and terrorized communities to rescue. But heroes who come here must deal with the Circle of Leth eventually. If they are not careful in where they go and how they answer challenges, they are certain to have, problems with the guardians of the Dale, possibly deadly ones.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Adventurers passing through the area find accommodations few and far between. A fast-moving traveler on foot requires at least fifteen to twenty days to walk the Great Road from Uthmere to Kront, depending on the weather. In that entire journey, she&#39;ll find inns or welcoming farmhouses for no more than three or four nights. It&#39;s rare for anyone to take in strangers. It doesn&#39;t matter if they are noble heroes on a quest to free Faer&ucirc;n from its worst nightmares. They&#39;ll have to earn the trust and friendship of the Dalesfolk, and that will not be the work of a day.</span></p><h1 class="c14" id="h.qmwdgd6w7bm4"><span class="c20">The Unapproachable East (1372)</span></h1><p class="c22 c19"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 341.33px;"><img alt="East" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 341.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">To the folks of the Heartlands, these lands are the mysterious, exotic, and deadly east, a region of terrible magic, untold wealth, and strange and capricious laws. The term &quot;Unapproachable&quot; generally describes the distance from the Heartlands of Faer&ucirc;n, but some of these countries are considered unapproachable because of their temperament. Thay is an aggressive magocracy, Aglarond defends its borders against all intruders, and Rashemen is a cold, hard land of powerful witches and fierce warriors. The lands of the Unapproachable East trade with the Old Empires because of their proximity, and Thesk is the avenue through which exotic goods from the far eastern lands of Kara-Tur enter Faer&ucirc;n.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This region is known for its powerful and strange magic.

Few give the country any more thought than this, but Aglarond is a place of ancient magic that holds one of the largest half-elf settlements in the world. Its army defends its borders against Thay; and its skilled rangers scout its frontier in search of trouble. The small beaches on Aglarond&#39;s rocky coast are dotted with fishing villages, and since the Simbul has declared that all pirates are to be considered agents of Thay (and put to death if caught), the waters around Aglarond are very safe to travel. It is one of the few kingdoms that refuses to allow Red Wizard enclaves within its borders.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.ktuu1m18l0xg"><span class="c6">Life and Society</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The humans of Aglarond are sturdy, no-nonsense fisherfolk, farmers, and herders unconcerned with the rest of Faer&ucirc;n. They are slow to warm to a person but faithful to those they trust. A serious and hard-working people, they nevertheless enjoy revelry and exuberant celebration when their chores are done. They dislike magic, pointing to the Red Wizards as proof that magic is a corrupting tool of wickedness. The exceptions are unusually good individuals, such as the rulers of their land who have always used magic to defend them. They believe in the divine powers, but have few large temples.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The half-elves of the Yuirwood are descended from wood elves. The various tribal groups that live deeper within the forest assume a nomadic and tribal culture, while those on the outskirts abide by local human customs. They have no qualms about using magic, and some of the wilder tribes know strange old elven secrets of the Yuirwood.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">All people of Aglarond are respectful of the Simbul, because it is her power that has kept the Red Wizards at bay for so long. How ever, that same power and her impetuous nature breed suspicion of her methods and motives.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.r0jqbszh4kh4"><span class="c6">Major Geographic Features</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Aglarond is a wooded peninsula projecting westward into the center of the Sea of Fallen Stars. It divides the Easting Reach from the Alamber Sea.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Tannath Mountains</span><span class="c0">: This range forms the southern edge of the Dragonjaw Mountains, south of the River Umber. The mountains are tall and rugged, flanked by wide passes. They have never been settled by humanoids, but griffons fly in the high peaks, and boulder-like creatures called galeb duhr live here. The Watchwall, a thirty-foot tall, ten-foot wide wall of smooth, seamless stone, runs for several miles from the mountains toward the fortress Glarondar in the Yuirwood.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Umber Marshes</span><span class="c0">: This span of bogs, swampland, and mudflats is Aglarond&#39;s first line of defense against Thay. Inhabited by dangerous creatures such as stirges, poisonous snakes, hydras, shambling mounds, trolls, and disease-carrying insects, the swamp has foiled attacks by Thayan armies more than once.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Yuirwood</span><span class="c13">: Home to the kingdom&#39;s half-elves, this forest is filled with old ruins. Detection and scrying magic cannot reach into the forest, and those who try see only a cluster of unremarkable trees rather than what they&#39;re looking for. This effect makes it difficult for enemies to discover the half-elves&#39; settlements and fortifications. Some of the forest&#39;s stone &#39;circle&#39;s act as </span><span class="c12">portals </span><span class="c0">to elsewhere in Toril (including Evermeet) and even other worlds.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.yvybo25fpqkd"><span class="c6">Important Sites</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Aglarond proper consists of the Yuirwood and the cities on the northern coast of the peninsula. The cities on the southern coast are independent and greatly threatened by Thay.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Altumbel</span><span class="c0">: This small human kingdom occupies the westernmost portion of the Aglarondan peninsula. It is loosely allied with Aglarond but has little contact with its neighbors. Its people are extremely reclusive, isolated, and outwardly hostile to non-humans. The dreary, constantly windswept place survives by fishing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Emmech (Small City, 7,620)</span><span class="c0">: This grim fortress holds over a third of Aglarond&#39;s army. A small town has sprung up around it, with the fortress looking over the town from a low hill. It holds enough supplies to feed its soldiers and everyone in the town for up to a six-month siege.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Furthinghome (Metropolis, 40,643)</span><span class="c0">: One of the first human settlements here, Furthinghome is a poor community, with many on the outskirts living in lean-tos and thatch huts. Its greenhouses hold the cultivated tropical flowers for which the city is known. The coastal waters are shallow, only allowing small vessels.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Relkath&#39;s Foot (Small City, 5,O8O)</span><span class="c0">: The largest permanent settlement of half-elves in the Yuirwood, this town is built around four large and very old trees. The town&#39;s militia is active in the region, frequently practicing ambushes and spying on passersby. Human rangers often seek training from the foresters of Relkath&#39;s Foot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Velprintalar (Metropolis, 66,044)</span><span class="c0">: This is the only major port in Aglarond. Its narrow buildings jumbled together can be confusing to visitors, and the city has no walls. Velprintalar is the meeting-place for Aglarond&#39;s council and the location of the Simbul&#39;s palace of green stone.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.gwkxkhjdi9my"><span class="c6">Regional History</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Long ago, the Yuirwood was inhabited by wood elves. They mastered powerful magic, built stone menhirs and &#39;circle&#39;s, and lived peacefully within their realm. Eventually monsters pushed into the elves&#39; territory, and the elves retreated to areas deeper within the wood. Humans arrived in this region in 756 DR, settling in the south, cutting wood, and clashing with monsters and the elves. When adventurers came to slay monsters, the elves of the Yuirwood retreated farther into the wood.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">After a time, humans penetrated the wards of the Yuir and allied with the weary elves. The humans helped the elves destroy monsters, and the two races intermarried. Their half-elven descendants began to reclaim the wood. Eventually they came into conflict with the humans on the coast, who had continued breed, populate, and log the forest The angry half-elves told the humans to stop but were ignored, and so they raided against the coastal dwellers, driving away or killing humans who resisted. In 1065 DR they fought the battle of Ingdal&#39;s Arm and sued for peace between the races, creating the nation of Aglarond. Some of the humans refused to share power and moved to the end of the peninsula to form the country of Altumbel.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Aglarond was ruled by a series of half-elven kings, many of whom were killed by Thayan invaders. Two heirs of the royal line, Thara and Ulae (known as the Gray Sisters) took the throne when their brother died, and they kept Aglarond safe for years. Ulae&#39;s daughter Ilione selected her apprentice, a woman known only as the Simbul, to be her heir, and the Simbul has defended her country against Thay ever since she took the throne in 1320 DR.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In 1371 DR the zulkirs approached the Simbul with an offer cease hostilities and declare a truce, which the Simbul accepted with a healthy dose of skepticism. The Thayans seem to be holding their end of the bargain, so the Simbul has turned her power to improving the lives of her people, as well as expanding the fortifications and wards against her longtime enemies.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.df78p2ofkres"><span class="c6">Plots and Rumors</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The old ruins of the Yuirwood bring adventurers to Aglarond, but the folk of the forest watch would-be plunderers and looters very carefully.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Dreams of Fire</span><span class="c0">: People in the eastern portion of the Yuirwood have begun experiencing magical hallucinations of the trees burning. There is no pattern to the hallucinations, and some people have had them several times while others not at all. The only link seems to be a Single carved stone half-buried in that part of the forest. A piece of the stone as long as a man&#39;s forearm has been chipped or broken from the main mass, and with it some of the elven rune- carvings.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">The Sentinels</span><span class="c0">: Something is causing the shambling mounds of the Umber Marshes to march toward the south. The shamblers have been forming a line just over a mile from the swamp&#39;s southern border, their bodies sometimes writhing with live snakes or buzzing with nests of insects. The plant-monsters stand in the line for days at a time; one occasionally leaves when a replacement arrives. The things attack other creatures they see, but otherwise appear to be waiting for something.</span></p><h2 class="c17 c19" id="h.9s2awyiudnm9"><span class="c23 c32">The Great Dale</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Capital</span><span class="c0">: none</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Population</span><span class="c0">: 211,680 (humans 99%)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Government</span><span class="c0">: Druidic hierarchy</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Religions</span><span class="c0">: Chauntea, Eldath, Mielikki, Silvanus</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Imports</span><span class="c0">: Gold, iron tools, silver</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Exports</span><span class="c0">: Alchemical items, arrows, bows, carved wood, herbs, magic items</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Alignment</span><span class="c0">: N, NG, CG</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c13"><a class="c27" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/greatdale/index.shtml&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1761072633839654&amp;usg=AOvVaw0XUQ8_NZX7_h0Seghp14Ye">More on the Great Dale</a></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Little more than two large forests and the strip of land between them, this land is inhabited by reclusive farmers, coolly hostile druids, and introspective rangers. The people of the Great Dale interact little with the outside world, acquiring the few iron items they cannot manufacture in exchange for herbal, alchemical, and wooden goods of exceptional quality. The soil is rich and suitable for farming, yet few other than the druids live here.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The mysterious Nentyarch, a powerful druid or sorcerer, resides in his castle of living trees and destroys all visitors. No outsiders know what he does or if he is the ruler of this place, and the people of the Great Dale answer inquiries to this effect with an uncomfortable shrug. The druids tolerate the trade route that passes between their forests only because caravaneers know that to disturb the forest is death, and accordingly they avoid it.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.c1ank3apfjgd"><span class="c6">Life and Society</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The settled villagers in the small hamlets live like rural folk in other lands, although they take great pains to take only what they need from the land. They live by hunting small game, farming small spaces of open prairie, and collecting dead wood from the forest. When enemies approach, the commoners (all of whom have some skill at survival, disappear into the woods, protected by the rangers and druids who mercilessly slay anyone that causes deliberate harm to the forest</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The rangers and druids tend to the plants and animals of their land, train students in the ways of nature, make fine wooden items, acquire rare herbs, and create things of magic and alchemy for trade. Open-minded youths are trained and then sent into the larger world to speak with other druids and rangers. Some of these travelers are given a treant seedling to plant in a deserving forest, or are told to slay followers of Malar.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.92x1qm9i4ctl"><span class="c6">Major Geographic Features</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Great Dale, stretches from the Easting Reach of the Inner Sea to the great lake of Ashane on the borders of Rashemen.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Forest of Lethyr</span><span class="c0">: This large forest has a thick canopy overhead, making its interior as dark as twilight even on the brightest days. Visitors report an aura of doom within its confines, and speak of sentient trees that actively resist the progressive decline of the woodlands. Large numbers of druids live in the forest; they are unfriendly to visitors, especially loggers. The southern portions enfold the small settlements of Spearsmouth Dale and Mettledale. Wandering Theskian orcs occasionally forage into the southern reach of the woodland.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Rawlinswood</span><span class="c0">: This forest is a near twin to the Forest of Lethyr to the south. Its narrowest point embraces the people of Denderdale, a small settlement of woodcutters and trappers. It is also the home of the Nentyarch and his fortress Dun-Tharos, hidden near the thick center of the wood. A &#39;circle&#39; of druids camps in the northwestern-most point of the forest, preventing any encroachment by the Damaran town of Tellerth.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.jznmptpx7qa4"><span class="c6">Important Sites</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The fallen empire of Narfell once held most of these lands; but now little remains of their cities and towers except vine-covered ruins in the forest.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Bezenul</span><span class="c0">: This waymeet is marked by ten dwarf-high stones spaced along the road at intervals of ten feet, the last of which bears a carving of a tree within a &#39;circle&#39;. Caravans use it as a rest stop and barter with the locals here.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">The Mucklestones</span><span class="c13">: This &#39;circle&#39; of stones carved with nature-runes is a holy site for the druids of Lethyr. The stones sometimes have different arrangements and move as a whole a short distance from year to year. The stones can act as a </span><span class="c12">portal </span><span class="c0">to certain other forests in Faer&ucirc;n, but some of the location-keys have been lost over time.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Nighthawk Tower</span><span class="c0">: This tower is actually an elaborate platform of branches and sturdy rope, built on top of a huge oak tree. Hensoi (NG male human Drdl2 of Silvanus), the druid here, has an affinity for birds of prey, and the local raptors come here if times are hard or they are injured. He is one of the more tolerant druids of the country, although hardly friendly.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Tower Threespires</span><span class="c0">: This tower has a broad base with three tall spires projecting from it. Built by a forgotten human who wanted to protect the land against invasions from the east, this tower would have fallen long ago if it weren&#39;t for the incredibly thick growth of vines wrapped around it, making it look like a giant three-fingered hand reaching upward. The druids conduct a secret yearly rite in this place.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Uthmere (Small City, 8,520)</span><span class="c0">: Only associated with the Great Dale by proximity, this place is populated by people from Impiltur, Damara, and Thesk. It serves as a way station for traders, and the residents warn those new to this trade route of the dangers of crossing the druids. Native folk who wish to trade for foreign goods occasionally visit Uthmere.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.fxo8p8h9gbo7"><span class="c6">Regional History</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Humans have lived in the Great Dale at least as far back as the Dalesfolk&#39;s crossing of the Dragon Reach into Cormanthor in -200 DR. In this entire time, none but humans have, been known to live here. In some places of the forest, ancient elven stone markers can be found, but no other signs of elven civilization. In all likelihood, this forest suffered some sort of calamity or mass exodus of its native elven and fey population, leaving it open to the humans who arrived later.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.d2xy4kxamyr2"><span class="c6">Plots and Rumors</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Adventurers come to the Great Dale to explore the forests and their strange ruins, but the land&#39;s powerful druids watch carefully over all their travels in the woods.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Ruins of Fortress Clymph</span><span class="c0">: Thought to be the legacy of the same person who built Tower Threespires, this ruin is cursed and avoided by the druids, rangers, and natural creatures of the forest.

While the Impilturrans vigorously defend their own borders, the government traditionally remains neutral and leaves neighboring lands to defend themselves. Impilturans see all sorts of raw valuables come from their northern neighbors and exotic goods arrive in their ports.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Among Faer&ucirc;nians elsewhere, Impiltur is often &quot;the Forgotten Kingdom.&quot; It has the mines and pines of the northern realms, but lacks witches or tyrants who send armies to attack neighboring countries. Its shipborne trade passes through the hands of either Sembia or Telflamm, so the Impilturran origin of the copper-work, silver, and iron bars is lost to purchasers. Impiltur is also the gateway to the riches of Damara, and a land fast growing in farmers now beginning to export smoked meats, cheeses, and fireslake (strong, sour wine of poor quality but great potency.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Impiltur is at peace with its neighbors, but persistent brigands, orc and hobgoblin raids out of the Earthspur Mountains, monsters aroused by the ongoing mining and prospecting, and intrigues hatched in the cities of Impiltur by agents of Thay, the newly energetic clergies of Shar, and other dark powers keep the armies of Impiltur war-ready.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.oubssfp3wb9c"><span class="c6">Life and Society</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Impiltur has grown wealthy from trade passing through it, for it is the gateway between the Cold Lands and the nations on the Sea of Fallen Stars. Its people are ready and willing to fight to defend themselves, but enjoy their peaceful lives. The strong militia is capable of fighting on the land, in the mountain lowlands, or on the water.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Typical patrols of the Warswords of Impiltur consist of twenty or more chainmail-clad, mounted warriors armed with lances and crossbows. A meeting with formidable monsters or strong foes leads to the summoning of additional patrols, or the hiring of adventurers to serve as &quot;swordpoints.&quot; Adventurers on swordpoint duty are allowed some measure of freedom from the usual laws of the land.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Given their country&#39;s role as a major trading state, Impilturans aren&#39;t surprised by different sorts of people, although elves and half-elves are still uncommon in this area. They are proud of the Council of Lords and the widowed Queen Sambryl (CG female human Ari5/Wiz4). The queen herself finds governing boring and prefers to let the council direct matters.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.7wmi5nvba760"><span class="c6">Major Geographic Features</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Impiltur stretches between the Sea of Fallen Stars and the Earth-spur Mountains.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Earthspur Mountains</span><span class="c0">: These tall peaks mark the western border of Impiltur, running from the Moonsea south to the Sea of Fallen Stars. A constant cold wind from the Glacier of the White Worm that tests at their center howls through the peaks. There are few trails and many monsters, but the Earthspurs are rich in gold, silver, and bloodstone. Mining communities survive here, although the dangers of the mountains contribute to a high mortality rate. Persistent rumors speak of a hidden pass leading from Impiltur west to the Vast, but no such route has ever been mapped.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">The Gray Forest</span><span class="c0">: Long ago this wood was inhabited by moon elves. When hobgoblins and other monsters began to encroach on their territory, the elves warred with them but lost ground steadily. Facing extinction but reluctant to abandon their homes, the elves transformed themselves into majestic trees with gray bark. &#39;circle&#39;s of these are now found within areas of normal trees. Impilturans (and other humanoids) avoid the forest entirely.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.lj47bq3wrge8"><span class="c6">Important Sites</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Impiltur today is a land of opportunity for the hard-working and the adventurous. With each passing month the inhabitants improve the roads, clear land for farms, and push back the frontier.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Dilpur (Metropolis, 31,838)</span><span class="c0">: This is a moderate-sized trade city, balancing its interests against all of Impiltur. The rulers of Dilpur are aware that an increase in mining is likely to cause merchants to shift to other cities with better access to trade routes and mines, so they stockpile resources to prevent this from occurring.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Hlammach (Metropolis, 36,386)</span><span class="c0">: This major seaport is walled and compact, populated with merchants, tradesfolk, and sailors. Its extensive docks are filled with ships. Hlammach is the site of the kingdom&#39;s mint, and thieves constantly try to steal the coins and trade bars stored here. Its small wizard school mainly teaches magic appropriate to the sea trade and spells to protect and ward valuables.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Lyrabar (Metropolis, 52,305)</span><span class="c0">: The largest city in this part of Faer&ucirc;n, Lyrabar is long and narrow, stretching along the water front for nearly a mile. Its large fleet consists of warships and merchant vessels, assuring security of its port. The city has good relations with Procampur and Tsurlagol, and it boasts a small wizard&#39;s school specializing in magic helpful to sailing.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.wc4shm2tvi2v"><span class="c6">Regional History</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">At least two realms of Impiltur have existed along the north coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars between the Earthspur and Earthfast mountains and the Easting Reach. The present realm was founded by the war-captain Imphras, who united four independent cities to face hobgoblin hordes advancing out of the Giantspire Mountains in 1095 DR. One of the military leaders proposed uniting their strength to form a nation, and the others agreed.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Impiltur has been a monarchy since, with a council of lords (most of them paladins or of lawful or good alignment) supporting and advising the monarch. Impiltur has a history of nonintervention, letting neighboring lands handle their own affairs unless such a hands-off policy would have major consequences for Impilturans. This policy makes them good trading partners but frustrating friends in times of war, as Damara found when it was invaded by Vaasa.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Today, Queen Sambryl, the widow of Imphras IV, rules Impiltur. She prefers to travel the land inspiring her people and aiding them in individual problems, serving as a willing figurehead for the true rulers of Impiltur: the twelve Lords of Imphras II, paladins indirectly descended from Imphras. These twelve serve as the vigilant war-captains of the realm and meet in council often to adjust their defenses and devise tasks for the troublesome or formidable adventurers of the land, sending such ready blades into conflict with Impiltur&#39;s foes.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.shmpgk68nivm"><span class="c6">Plots and Rumors</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Although the Tuigan horde never reached Impiltur, the chaos of refugees fleeing it plunged the realm into poverty, starvation, and brigandry, and order was maintained only within the walled seaport cities. Rich new mines have recently been found north of Lyrabar and near the High Pass, however, and the realm is growing in wealth, trade, and confidence.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Forest Secrets</span><span class="c0">: The hobgoblins of the Gray Forest have been marshaling under a new leader. This leader is said to be either a vampire or a werewolf, commanding dire wolves that aid his tribe in their attacks. The hobgoblins may have one or more lairs in the nearby Earthfast Mountains as well as in their forest homes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">What Waits Below</span><span class="c0">: One of the newest mines in the Earthspurs has broken through into an old dwarven temple. Exploration of this temple reveals it to be dedicated to Laduguer, the evil deity of the gray dwarves. Several smaller tunnels have been found leading downward. The miners are looking for a band of adventurers to explore the tunnels and determine if they connect to gray dwarven settlements in the Underdark, while at least one merchants&#39; guild is preparing an expedition to see if the gray dwarves would be willing to engage in trade.</span></p><h2 class="c17 c19" id="h.z6rbd4ofyo5i"><span class="c23 c32">Rashemen</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Capital</span><span class="c0">: Immilmar</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Population</span><span class="c0">: 654,48O (humans 99%)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Government</span><span class="c0">: Monarchy/magocratic gynarchy</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Religions</span><span class="c0">: Bhalla (Chauntea), the Hidden One (Mystra), Khelliara (Mielikki)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Imports</span><span class="c0">: Cloth, food, wood products</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Exports</span><span class="c0">: Carvings, cheese, firewine, furs, wool</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Alignment</span><span class="c0">: NG, CG, N</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c13"><a class="c27" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/rashemen/index.shtml&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1761072633874911&amp;usg=AOvVaw3K5SzHWw7qUc8qfWiOV_yy">More on Rashemen</a></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Rashemen is a cold, rugged land, populated by hardy and fiercely independent people. Its men are berserkers, disdaining armor and fighting with axe, spear, sword, and bow. Its women wield powerful magic tied to the land, training those with magical potential to serve the land and the Rashemi race. Although Rashemen is ostensibly ruled by a powerful warrior called the Iron Lord, the true powers behind the throne are the Witches, who choose the Iron Lord.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The land is full of nature spirits, any of which can turn jealous or vindictive against those who offend them. Rashemi laws are simple and based on honor, and they disdain the trappings of civilization. The people are devoted to the warrior ideal competing in athletic contests and other harsh physical activities such as swimming in near-freezing rivers. These challenges keep them strong, for weakness would doom them to death at the claws of the land&#39;s many monsters.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.ok5ew871zziz"><span class="c6">Life and Society</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Faer&ucirc;n knows Rashemen as the Land of Berserkers, a cold, alpine-and-rock land of fierce warriors ruled by masked Witches. Colorful tales tell of the Witches&#39; cruelty - but such stories stray far from the truth. The Witches rule with absolute authority, sternly and firmly, but they hate cruelty, having repeatedly tasted it at Thayan hands.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Rashemi warriors are fur-clad or leather-armored pony riders. Showing cowardice or incompetence at arms results in shunning. They fight in loosely disciplined warbands known as Fangs, each led by a chieftain. In time of war, Witches command the Fangs. When fighting, a Witch of Rashemen wears black robes and a mask, arming herself with magic rings and whips that dance in the air, animating to fight by themselves while their owners cast spells.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The armies of Rashemen are commanded by the Huhrong, or Iron Lord, who is expected to be the epitome of the Rashemi warrior. He is chosen by vote of the Witches, during a secret meeting at which any Witch may propose any person as Huhrong. The Iron Lord is expected to rule wisely, keeping order rather than deciding policy. It&#39;s his task to keep travel between cities safe, frontiers secure, and marauding monsters to a minimum. The Witches instruct and protect the Iron Lord, and can remove him from office at will.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Throughout the land, Witches are revered and heeded. It&#39;s certain death to harm a Witch, and usually death to disobey one (unless one is a child, another Witch, or an ignorant outlander defying the word of a Witch for the first time. Among themselves, Witches strive to understand living things and their fellow Rashemi, so that open disputes are few. Their manipulation steers folk toward agreement, and the land is kept strong and united, regarding Thayans as deadly foes and Rashemen as sacred land to be protected and tended. All Witches are female; the few magic-wielding males in the country are known as Vremyonni, or Old Ones, because they are preserved by magic to great age. Kept hidden in the Running Rocks, they devote themselves to crafting new spells and the magic items the Witches use in battle.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Most Rashemi never leave the, realm after the </span><span class="c12">dajemma</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of their youth, a year-long journey wherein youthful Rashemi become adults and see the world. Age, experience, and accomplishment determine rank within the Witches (the age of most Vremyonni placing them high among the Wychiaran, the Witches&#39; name for themselves and then in the same order within all native Rashemi who cannot work magic, with outlanders ranked at the bottom.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Rashemi are a short, muscular, hardy race, given to cross-country racing in fierce winter weather, exploring the old northern ruins of fallen Raumathar, and hunting snowcats while unarmored and lightly armed. They herd sheep, goats, and snow roth&eacute;, export wool, furs, carved stone, bone, and </span><span class="c12">jhuild,</span><span class="c13">&nbsp;or firewine (which costs as much as 15 gp per tallglass elsewhere in Faer&ucirc;n} Rashemi love </span><span class="c12">sjorl</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a heavy, smoky-flavored cheese that outlanders find horrible.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.kzv2v4gq2f04"><span class="c6">Major Geographic Features</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">To visitors, Rashemen seems very wild, with few cultivated areas, roads little better than dirt tracks, and few dwellings. Rashemi farms are usually hidden in bowl valleys, forest clearings, and along stream banks, with boulder and &quot;wild-hedge&quot; fences. Rashemi homes are typically caves, built into hillsides or covered with earthen mounds.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Ashenwood</span><span class="c0">: Thu ancient forest&#39;s mighty spirits live in the stones and trees. It is not settled by the Rashemi, and while they sometimes enter the wood to hunt, they do so only after paying respect to the local spirits. Owlbears, trolls, and ettercaps also live here.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">The High Country</span><span class="c0">: This northernmost portion of the Sunrise Mountains is a place of ancient, dark hills, old stone monoliths, and wild magic. It is home to kobolds, goblins, trolls, wolves, winter wolves, and the ghosts of Rashemi and Tuigan dead. It is sparsely inhabited by grim hunters who prefer solitude.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Immil Vale</span><span class="c0">: This area north of the Ashenwood is continually warm and green even in winter. This eternal springtime temperature is due to hot springs and a small amount of volcanic activity; vents and fumaroles of steam are common; often filling the vale with mist. Like most places in Rashemen, there are many spirits here.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Lake Ashane</span><span class="c0">: This glacial body of water is also known as the Lake of Tears because of the battles fought on its shores. It is protected by odd aquatic creatures - nixies, nereids, and types unknown, all ruled by a great water spirit.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">The North Country</span><span class="c0">: Spoken of as a different land, this region contains ruins from Narfell and Raumathar. These ruins are full of ancient magic and treasure protected by guardian spirits, spells, and monsters. Rashemi nobles explore these places to prove their bravery.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Urlingwood</span><span class="c0">: This forest at the north end of the Sunrise Mountains is dense and wild. The Witches spend much time here, communing with the spirits, making offerings, performing binding rituals, and brewing the potent Rashemen firewine. Outsiders are forbidden to enter the forest, and those caught are put to death. To protect would-be visitors, representatives of the Iron Lord patrol the outer perimeter. Most Witches actually live in the nearby town of Urling.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.yhawcj84lqts"><span class="c6">Important Sites</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Rashemi live close to the land, preferring unspoiled wildness to gardens, fences, and elaborate buildings. Rashemi disdain cities as &quot;the wallows of those who&#39;ve gone soft,&quot; and live in the countryside, dressing lightly even in cold weather.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Immilmar (Large City, 21,210)</span><span class="c0">: This city is home to the Iron Lord&#39;s citadel. Crafted of iron and stone, the citadel was built with the aid of the Witches. The central portion of the city is built around the citadel, with farther-out homes more like regular Rashemi homes. The cleric of the small temple of Chauntea here makes sure that worship of &quot;Bhalla&quot; doesn&#39;t stray too far from official doctrine.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Mulptan (Metropolis, 39,390)</span><span class="c0">: This city is Rashemen&#39;s northern trading gateway to the outside world. A great field outside town is crowded with traders from many lands. The two primary noble families, the Ydrass and Vrul, sponsor contests as friendly rivals. The competition has improved both families; they are accomplished warriors, hunters, and artisans.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Mulsantir (Large Town, 4,948)</span><span class="c0">: This town is the primary point for Thayan attack. It has been besieged at least five times but never fallen, due to the solid stone walls created by the Witches. Its large fishing fleet nets sturgeon in the nearby lake that bears the town&#39;s name.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.zgl2096c4wub"><span class="c6">Regional History</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Rashemen is an old land, with settlements dating back to the time when it was disputed ground between Narfell and Raumathar. Years after the collapse of those two empires, the people united to form a nation, aided by the Witches, who offered their protection in exchange for the right to select the kings and war leaders, since the first one in -75 DR.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Rashemen has defended itself against Mulhorandi invasions, multiple Thayan invasions, and even the Tuigan horde, surviving it all and holding its territory. With its traditional enemies (the Red Wizards) pursuing other tasks, Rashemen is fortifying its southern border in anticipation of eventual treachery.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.a0j00e1ubav7"><span class="c6">Plots and Rumors</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Dangerous wildlands, fierce berserkers, and a suspicious population deter all but the most resourceful outlander adventurers from exploring Rashemen&#39;s mysteries.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">The Hag Queen</span><span class="c0">: Citadel Rashemar was besieged and destroyed by the Tuigan horde. Now a pile of shattered stone, it is used as a lair by goblins, giant spiders, and hags. These creatures have begun to harry the nearby Rashemi villages, directed by a shrewd hag with formidable sorcerous powers. Already she has slain two Witches who entered her domain, and the Wychlaran want revenge.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Walk of the Old Ones</span><span class="c0">: A group of Old Ones has grown tired of living lives of isolation and wish to see more of the world. The Witches denied the Old Ones their request, fearing that their knowledge could fall into the wrong hands. The unhappy Old Ones chose to escape anyway, and they need a guide for the few tendays before they return to their duties. Meanwhile, agents of rival powers (such as the Red Wizards and the Zhents) are trying to capture the male Rashemen wizards for the information they hold. The adventurers may need to negotiate between the Old Ones and the Witches, for the latter are intolerant of those who shirk their duties.</span></p><h2 class="c17 c19" id="h.fdt3zz23n1ds"><span class="c23 c32">Thay</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Capital</span><span class="c0">: Eltabbar</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Population</span><span class="c0">: 4,924,800 (humans 62%, gnolls 10%, orcs 10%, dwarves 8%, goblins 5%, halflings 4%</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Government</span><span class="c0">: Magocracy</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Religions</span><span class="c0">: Bane, Gargauth, Kelemvor, Kossuth, Loviatar, Malar, Shar, Talona, Umberlee</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Imports</span><span class="c0">: Iron, magic items, monsters, slaves, spells</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Exports</span><span class="c0">: Artwork, fruit, grains, jewelry, magic items, sculpture, timber</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Alignment</span><span class="c0">: LE, NE, N</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c13"><a class="c27" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/thay/index.shtml&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1761072633895127&amp;usg=AOvVaw2VOFt0ZmwZ93XrwBey_L29">More on Thay</a></span></p><p class="c19 c22"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 400.00px; height: 522.00px;"><img alt="map" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 400.00px; height: 522.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay is a nation ruled by cruel wizards who rely on slavery to provide them with the wealth and luxury they need to support their magical research and dreams of conquest. The land is ruled by eight zulkirs, the most powerful wizards of the land. The zulkirs in turn choose the land&#39;s tharchions, civil governors who manage the mundane affairs of the realm and serve at the pleasure of the Red Wizards.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The power of the Red Wizards extends far beyond Thay&#39;s borders. Red Wizard enclaves exist in dozens of major cities through- out the Inner Sea lands, exchanging magic items for the goods, riches, and - in some cases - slaves of a dozen lands. The Thayans are widely disliked and distrusted, but their growing stranglehold on the trade in magic devices makes them virtually indispensable to many of their clients.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">The zulkirs back in the homeland grow rich beyond belief with the spread of their sinister trade. They constantly scheme and plot against their neighbors. (See </span><span class="c15 c13"><a class="c27" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/organizations/redwizards.shtml&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1761072633896917&amp;usg=AOvVaw33zXN8bsT__jlAxolPHHUR">Organizations</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for more information about the individual zulkirs.) Thayan armies have marched on Aglarond and Rashemen many times, and folk think it is only a matter of time before the Thayans revert to their old habits of taking what they want through force of arms and deadly spells.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.uxrbxa4p35m"><span class="c6">Life and Society</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">To Faer&ucirc;nians, Thay is a dark and evil empire where cruel Red Wizards endlessly crack whips over screaming, groaning slaves who are spell-transformed into weird monsters as their &quot;reward&quot; for back-breaking service.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The truth is only a little different.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Red Wizards form an elite Class, the nobility of the land. Through the vast, regional bureaucracy administered by their hand picked tharchions, they govern Thay&#39;s laws, commerce, and society. Free Thayans fall into one of six classes: Red Wizards, bureaucrats, priests, merchants, soldiers, and artisans or skilled workers - barely a step above slaves themselves. Neither priests nor merchants are especially common in Thay.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">All Thayan children are examined for magical aptitude at an early age. Those who show signs of potential are removed from their parents and subjected to ever more rigorous schooling in the arcane arts, culminating in apprenticeships to the Red Wizards, who are notoriously careless of and abusive toward their apprentices. (Those whose talents run to sorcery channel their talents into wizardry, suppress them, or leave the country. The Red Wizards despise sorcerers, who don&#39;t follow the carefully regimented system of &#39;magical schools&#39;.) The survivors become Red Wizards upon completion of their training, but the organization is far from democratic or benevolent - to hold real power, a young Red Wizard must master as much arcane might as she possibly can, and wield it ruthlessly and without hesitation against her fellows.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thayan policy is decided in council by the zulkirs, wizards representing schools of magical specialization. Each zulkir is elected by Red Wizards prominent in that magical school, and then serves for as long as she can hold office - alive or in undeath. Although every zulkir has rivals seeking to destroy her, zulkirs tend to be shrewd, ruthless, and good administrators (or they don&#39;t last long).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay is divided into &quot;tharchs,&quot; each ruled by a tharchion responsible for local roads and bridges, sanitation, military defense, irrigation or water transport, and peacekeeping. The tharchions, or civil rulers, in turn appoint autharchs, or bureaucrats and, underlings. Autharchs are generally chosen from the most competent soldiers, well-off families with a tradition of civil service, or more rarely merchants or free Thayans who simply demonstrate unusual competence. Red Wizards occasionally scheme for an appointment as a tharchion to increase their own personal power and wealth.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">All of the tharchions and zulkirs can muster their own armies, and many Red Wizards have multiple bodyguards, so Thay supports a haphazard array of fighting forces. These units range from nearly naked goblins fighting in mobs to plate-armored and highly trained cavalry riding flying steeds or magically augmented mounts of various sorts. These forces often skirmish unofficially when their rulers have a disagreement, or when one catches another doing something overly illicit.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay used to fight Aglarond and Rashemen almost continuously, but tasted defeat far too often to continue such enthusiastic hostile ties. In the increasingly uncommon &quot;general war&quot; situations, Thay can send at least two special units into battle: the vast Legion of Bone, a regimented unit of marching armored skeletons, and the fearsome Griffon Legion, four hundred battle-skilled Red Wizards hurling spells and dropping incendiaries from griffonback.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay has a small but growing &quot;middle class&quot; of free folk who are either servant-staff to zulkirs or tharchions, or else merchants and traveling trade-agents. Free Thayans are perhaps the closest to what the folk of Thay would be like without magical oppression. They are careful folk who show their emotions as little as possible, affect a manner of smooth politeness, and take secret glee in watching dancing, revelry, foolishness, and amusements, but never dare to participate. They tend to eat and drink prodigiously but have strong constitutions (and tolerances for poisons and bad food), and rarely show drunkenness or ill effects from what they consume.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In Thay, slaves are everywhere. Thriving slave markets hawk the living wares of slavers who bring &quot;merchandise&quot; from Amn, Calimshan, Chessenta, Mulhorand, Semphar, and Thesk. The majority of slaves are human, but orcs, goblins, gnolls, half-ores, and halflings also appear for sale. Thayans still mount slaving raids, on other free lands, but most slaves are acquired in trade.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Although slaves may be altered in any way by their owners at a whim, they are forbidden to cut their own hair or choose their own garb (most are kept near naked). Many slaves last only a few years before dying or being put to death.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thayans frown on those who treat slaves with wanton cruelty (crippling or weakening punishments are bad for business, wasting valuable property). Nevertheless, slaves are put to death for minor infractions, to guard against the greatest fear of all noble Thayans: bloody and countrywide slave uprising.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Red Wizards of Thay are infamous for their &quot;immoral&quot; magical experimentations - but they&#39;d be far more of a danger to the rest of Faer&ucirc;n if the internal infighting among their ranks wasn&#39;t so vicious and vigorous.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Red Wizards shave all the hair on their heads (including eyebrows and often eyelashes), and sometimes all over their bodies, and most tattoo themselves heavily. Such tattoos are often a means of magically storing spells for emergency use (the source of many &quot;miraculous escapes&quot; for Thayans imprisoned in other countries). In Thay, only Red Wizards are allowed to wear red robes. They learn iron self-control as quiet, careful underlings to powerful senior mages, and only dare to scheme when they command a powerful roster of personal spells.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay is an ungainly, internally riven powerhouse of a nation - but also one that is feared, hated, and carefully watched by all its neighbors.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.ipbl71chxylv"><span class="c6">Major Geographic Features</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay is a hot, often dry, wind-scoured land where many thirst for freedom or greater power. A careful and constantly renewed web-work of spells keeps the weather good for crops with soaking rains on most nights and warm but not harsh heat during the day. The abundant slave power maintains high food production, allowing locally made beer and bread to sustain slaves along with the endlessly available boiled or pickled vegetables. Thay exports a lot of grain, but could sell a good deal more if its rulers weren&#39;t so wary of attack and didn&#39;t keep building (and filling to bursting) granary after granary.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Lake Thaylambar</span><span class="c0">: This vast, deep lake provides rich fishing grounds despite its dragon turtles, which enjoy its icy depths and snack on fishing vessels. Thayan nobles occasionally go on hunting expeditions for the creatures, with about half coming home with a trophy and half never being seen again.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">The Plateau of Thay</span><span class="c0">: The heart of Thay is its central, heavily settled plateau. Here frequent human and gnoll patrols keep a vigilant watch for outlanders and escaped slaves, operating out of small fortresses known as tax stations.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The tax stations are surrounded by villages where free Thayans dwell, providing services and goods to the vast, fertile farms that sprawl across the plateau. Slaves labor over the crops, their lives spent swiftly and carelessly in the production of prodigious amounts of food. Every inch of the plateau is tamed. Where the land is not cleared and fenced for farms or villages, one finds the towers and demesnes of Red Wizards (who, rapt in their schemes and researches, do not welcome uninvited visitors}</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">Inquisitive mages of other lands who dare to scry onto the plateau discover that overlapping wards in many places now approaching the strength of the fabled </span><span class="c12">mythals </span><span class="c0">of old - overlie the land, effectively preventing spying from afar. Those who have reason to be wary of the Red Wizards greatly regret this divination &quot;shield&quot; and seek other ways to learn the Thayans&#39; schemes.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Surmarsh</span><span class="c0">: Tribes of lizardfolk inhabit this dreary, fever-ridden swamp. Some of these tribes serve as occasional troops in the armies of Thay, which is considered a great honor to the scaly people. Nobles enter the swamp to hunt the monsters that flourish here.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Thaymount</span><span class="c0">: At the center of the Plateau of Thay loom the rugged volcanic peaks known collectively as Thaymount. Earth quakes and ash eruptions indicate that local volcanism is increasing, but the Red Wizards haven&#39;t abandoned their fortresses on the mountain flanks. Instead, they seem to be rushing to and from them more often, called to secret councils and engaged in building new and ever larger fortifications.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay&#39;s military reserve (thousands of gnolls, darkenbeasts, and other fell creatures) is quartered in Thaymount, and the mountains are also known to contain both the rich gold mines that have funded the Red Wizards for years and worked-out mines that descend into the Underdark. Thaymount is home to the ancient Citadel (see Plots and Rumors, below) where it&#39;s whispered that runaway spells still rage uncontrolled.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Secret force&#39;s of magically twisted folk and monsters have emerged from the grim fortresses of Thaymount and gone out into Faer&ucirc;n on sinister missions. Thay&#39;s magical workshops and armories lie in this region, too, worked by hundreds and hundreds of the younger Red Wizards at the command of their superiors.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.fng2d4d4rttx"><span class="c6">Important Sites</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Red Wizards have divided Thay into eleven tharchs each ruled by a tharchion.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Alaor</span><span class="c0">: This tharch consists of the pair of islands off the southern coast of Thay and houses the nation&#39;s largest naval base (large city, 29,720). Heavily damaged in the salamander war (see Regional History, below), it was rebuilt with modern facilities.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Delhumide</span><span class="c0">: This tharch held the capital of the Thayan province when Mulhorand still controlled this area. The capital and other signs of civilization were destroyed in the independence war. The tharch now consists of ruins and slave farms. Its tharchion is a proponent of the magic trade, hoping to increase the prosperity of his poor territory.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Eltabbar</span><span class="c0">: This tharch is of tremendous political importance. Its tharchion (Dmitra Flass, LE female human Ill7/Red8) strives to discourage feuds and intrigues among the zulkirs and advocates expanding the trade in magic items even further. She is married to the High Blade of Mulmaster, a political union that has brought Thay greater access to the Moonsea through its Mulmaster enclave.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The tharch contains the Thayan capital, also called Eltabbar (metropolis, 123,120). The city is huge, packed with slaves, and home to numerous slave auctions. The canals flowing through the city once helped to empower a spell that kept a great demon imprisoned under it, although that demon has since escaped due to weakening of the spell by an earthquake.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Gauros</span><span class="c0">: This tharch on the northeastern end of Thay often skirmishes with Rashemen over its mineral-rich hills. The tharchion of Gauros hates Rashemen and constantly schemes to destroy that land despite mandates from the zulkirs for a temporary peace.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Lapendrar</span><span class="c0">: A clerk of Kossuth rules the southwestern tharch of Lapendran. Though theoretically independent, the city of Amruthar (metropolis, 41,040) pays tribute to Thay to keep from being annexed. There is a minimal Thayan presence, and while no Red Wizards live here, some do visit The wealthy rulers live decadently and luxuriously. Some Amrutharans want to sever all ties with Thay, making them fully independent, and some want to join Aglarond, which realistically is too far away to provide any aid. Escalant (metropolis, 28,728) has a history of alternating between independence from Thay and occupation by the Red Wizards. Currently Thay is in charge, although the locals are left to go their own way. The sprawling city is garrisoned with gnolls from the Thayan army.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Priador</span><span class="c0">: The people of the Priador tharch have been terrified into submission by their tharchion, who rules with an iron fist. Currently the region prospers, but the zulkirs plan to intervene if trade falls off. Bezantur (metropolis, 136,800), Thay&#39;s largest city, is vital to the country&#39;s prosperity due to its sea trade. The city is plagued by powerful thieves&#39; guilds. It is a major religious center, with temples to almost every deity but Azuth and Mystra.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Pyarados</span><span class="c0">: The mountains of this tharch contain rich minerals. The walled city of the same name (metropolis; 54,720) is open to adventurers, even foreign ones, as long as these visitors don&#39;t threaten Thayan interests. The city&#39;s foreign quarter lies outside the city walls. The authorities turn a blind eye to crime, leaving street justice to settle matters. The city is often a launching point for adventurers delving into the Sunrise Mountains.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Surthay</span><span class="c0">: This small tharch is mainly used as a staging ground for attacks against Rashemen. The locals survive through subsistence farming and trade with Theskian merchants. The city of Surthay (large city, 17,784) was originally built as a stronghold against attacks by the Rashemi, but now serves as a base for troops ready to attack that nation. Its proximity to the swamps means it often suffers strange plagues.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Thaymount</span><span class="c0">: This tharch has a large military fortress and gold mines among its central mountains. Because Thaymount is used as the headquarters for the zulkirs, activities here are kept secret from all but the most privileged Red Wizards.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Thazalhar</span><span class="c0">: This tharch controls trade routes to Mulhorand. Its tharchion is a retired general who extracts high tolls for caravans and travelers. The place is mostly a graveyard, since the wars with Mulhorand caused the area much damage. At night some portions are haunted by undead and the spirits of slain warriors.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Tyraturos</span><span class="c0">: This well-patrolled thatch controls the two main high ways through the country. The city of Tyraturos (metropolis, 68,490 is large and sprawling, with a huge slave marketplace where almost any creature can be had for a price, including exotic ones such as lamia, centaurs, and drow. Visitors must be careful to avoid being captured and sold into slavery only a few blocks from their inn.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.i9uzndwo8nt1"><span class="c6">Regional History</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">For centuries, the region of Thay was under the rule of the powerful Mulhorandi Empire. Its native people, a Rashemi race, were subject to the rule of a noble class, the Mulan of Mulhorand. The great mage Ythazz Buvarr, a member of a Mulhorandi secret society called the Red Wizards, sought to create a separate realm where wizards would rule instead of the god-kings. Ythazz and his followers raised an army and sacked the capital of the Thayan province. The Red Wizards succeeded in destroying all opposition from their former masters and established the land of Thay in 922 DR.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In the years since then, Thay has tried many times to annex portions of Aglarond and Rashemen, sometimes with the assistance of drow, demons, assassination, or even artificially created natural disasters. Each attempt failed, mainly because the Red Wizards could never successfully cooperate with each other. The most recent attempt involved bargaining with the leaders of the efreet and salamanders from the Elemental Plane of Fire. When their allies turned on them, the clerics of Kossuth, lord of the fire elementals, were able to persuade their deity to intervene and rout the other outsiders, greatly elevating Kossuth&#39;s church in the eyes of the Thayans.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">With outright conquest denied them, the zulkirs discovered that a great demand for Thayan goods - specifically magic items - exists in the cities oi the Inner Sea. Given the number of Red Wizards and the traditions of years of servitude as apprentices and low-ranking members of the organization, the Red Wizards found that they could easily mobilize a large number of mages to manufacture potent magic items for sale and undercut other wizards with commercial aspirations.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Over the last several years, this trade has grown from a convenient way to fill the zulkirs&#39; coffers and extract useful value from apprentices into an extremely rewarding enterprise. At the direction of one zulkir or another, mid-ranking Red Wizards have established enclaves - walled compounds or fortress-like footholds - in Faer&ucirc;nian cities to purvey their magical goods in exchange for the wealth of a dozen lands.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Given the success of the mercantile efforts and the traditional failures of overt conquest, a new faction has arisen within the Red Wizards, supporting mercantile rather than military expansion. Grudgingly, the zulkirs (led by the lich Szass Tam, the zulkir of Necromancy and arguably the most powerful Red Wizard in Thay) have agreed to cease direct and overt hostilities against other nations for a time to see whether trade alone can accomplish their objectives. In the meantime, tenuous truces hold along the Aglarondan and Rashemi borders.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.20yype6smxk6"><span class="c6">Plots and Rumors</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay&#39;s aggressive slaving and the abominable conditions of the slaves within its borders attract good adventurers eager to strike a blow against the cruel Red Wizards.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">The Buried Ones</span><span class="c0">: One group of adventurers exploring the Sunrise Mountains has come back with a tale of strange pale humans they found in a newly opened cave. These humans have the same features as the ruling Mulan race in Thay, but are as pale as albinos and almost completely blind. They wield weapons of gold that are as hard as steel and cast strange magic that gives off no light The adventurers told the story in Pyarados before they left to fight these creatures, who many in Thay believe to be a degenerate off shoot of Mulhorandi trapped centuries ago.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">The Citadel</span><span class="c0">: On the northern edge of the mountains in the Thaymount tharch is an old fortress simply called the Citadel. It predates the arrival of humans in this area and was built by a race of intelligent lizardfolk, possibly the progenitors of the now-primitive tribes living in the Surmarsh. Infested by troglodytes, rasts, and other subterranean species (including drow), the Citadel is said to connect to the Underdark.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Red Wizards and powerful Thayan adventurers explore the fortress. Recently the number of expeditions has increased, many of them sponsored by the zulkirs themselves and often including foreigners. Whether these sponsored adventuring groups will be allowed to leave Thay with the information or treasure they find is another matter.</span></p><h2 class="c17 c19" id="h.5aoy8c6chhn3"><span class="c23 c32">Thesk</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Capital</span><span class="c0">: none</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Population</span><span class="c0">: 855,360 (humans 85%, gnomes 8%, orcs 6%)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Government</span><span class="c0">: Oligarchy</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Religions</span><span class="c0">: Chauntea, Mask, Shaundakul, Waukeen</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Imports</span><span class="c0">: Gold, horses, trade goods</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Exports</span><span class="c0">: Food, gnome goods, iron, Kara-Turan goods</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Alignment</span><span class="c0">: N, NG, CG</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c15 c13"><a class="c27" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/thesk/index.shtml&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1761072633927558&amp;usg=AOvVaw0hRAPy6tg8Qmmi3OffSf4V">More on Thesk</a></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thesk is a land of shrewd but friendly merchants and able farmers. The trade route that leads to the far land of Kara-Tur allows the Theskians to see all kinds of people and interact with many cultures, making Thesk one of the more tolerant nations in Faer&ucirc;n. After being decimated by the Tuigan horde, the people of Thesk are rebuilding their cities and towns, and they have even made a home for the orc army left behind by the Zhentarim.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Theskians&#39; familiarity with quality and obscure goods makes them skilled at appraising items. Arcane magic in this land is rare; that fact, along with the influence of the Shadowmasters, a thieves&#39; guild backed by the church of Mask, makes Thesk more than just another realm of traders.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.4rwrctj6g8j4"><span class="c6">Life and Society</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">People in the rural areas of Thesk live like common folk, tending to their soil and livestock. Unlike in other parts of Faer&ucirc;n, a number of the farmers and ranchers in Thesk are full-blooded orcs. Orcs also inhabit the cities, blending in with the other merchants and workers who serve the Golden Way, the major trade route that connects Faer&ucirc;n to the Utter East. Acclimatized to strange faces, languages, and goods, the people of Thesk have a long history of profiting from caravans from all parts of the world and go out of their way to welcome visitors.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.fct9xud4hpu7"><span class="c6">Major Geographic Features</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thesk lies between the Plateau of Thay and the Forest of Lethyr. Vast portions of the land are virtually empty - most folk live along the road from Telflamm to Two Stars.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Ashanath</span><span class="c0">: This unsettled region&#39;s good soil is covered in thick, short grass, and small herds of wild oxen and ponies roam its entire length. It would be an excellent place for farms and could easily support one or more city-states except for the tornadoes that race across the landscape in summertime, sometimes as often as once a tenday. The tornadoes are thought to be side effects of the weather-controlling magic the Red Wizards frequently use to benefit their crops. The plain is also home to bulettes and ankhegs.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Dragonjaw Mountains</span><span class="c0">: The clans of gnomes in this mountain range are frequent visitors to the human city of Milvarune, which exists mainly to distribute the tools, inventions, weapons, jewelry, and quality iron ingots the gnomes produce. The mountain is populated by at least two copper dragons that engage in joke-contests with the gnomes on an annual basis.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Thest Mountains</span><span class="c0">: These mountains are bare and inhospitable, prone to small landslides and sudden dropoffs. Their few moderate veins of iron supply the country&#39;s needs plus a small amount for export</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.2onp87lgxtuq"><span class="c6">Important Sites</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Golden Way is by far the most important feature of Thesk.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Nyth (Small City, 11,501): </span><span class="c0">Previously under the control of Telflamm, Nyth once again considers itself part of Thesk and trades freely with its sister cities, including Telflamm. The city received its name from the will-o&#39;-wisplike creature that used to haunt the western edge of the Forest of Lethyr. A cabal of wizards eradicated the nyth in a battle of mutual destruction. Since that time, wizards have been respected in Nyth but are thought doomed to meet a bad end.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Phsant (Large City, 21,564)</span><span class="c0">: This city is famous as the site of the defeat of the Tuigan horde by the armies of the western alliance. The orc soldiers from the Zhent army settled in this area and have adapted remarkably well. Some work on farms, some have purchased small farms of their own, and others work as mercenaries, laborers, and guards. The other orcs in Thesk work as miners in the Thesk Mountains, returning here to visit with their old tribemates. Some of the orcs have married local women, but the rest are still looking for wives, drawing a steady flow of half-orc women to this area in search of strong husbands of a more civilized mindset than they might find in an orc tribe.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Tammar (Large Town, 3,594)</span><span class="c0">: Nearly razed to the ground by the Tuigan, this city was held for a while by a large group of bandits who extorted heavy tolls from caravans passing through their land. The oligarchy paid a squadron of one hundred orcs to root out the bandits, and now the tusked warriors are hailed as heroes in this town, which has been rebuilt and resettled by its original residents.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c10">Telflamm (Large City, 23,361)</span><span class="c0">: This city sits at the end of the Golden Way, profiting greatly from the trade route by controlling access to the Sea of Fallen Stars. Independent from Thesk but closely allied with its neighbor, Telflamm is ostensibly ruled by a &quot;merchant prince.&quot; Actually, the city is firmly under the control of the Shadowmasters. This thieves&#39; guild owns the city&#39;s inns, festhalls, and gambling halls, in addition to extorting &quot;protection&quot; lees from merchants and wealthy alike.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">The Shadowmasters are led by the local high priest of Mask (whose temple in the city, the House of the Master&#39;s Shadow, is Faer&ucirc;n&#39;s largest to that deity). He knows a ritual that allows a worshiper to exchange a portion of his or her life force for the ability to </span><span class="c12">shadow walk </span><span class="c0">once per day. This ability has served the guild greatly in the year since the ritual&#39;s discovery. The Shadowmasters maintain safe houses in every city in Thesk.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.r1dlpbcev5x3"><span class="c6">Regional History</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Founded in 937 DR by a coalition of friendly trading and agricultural cities, Thesk has long been a land of farmers profiting from the trade that passes through their country to and from the lands of Kara-Tur.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Golden Way has allowed Theskians to become very wealthy, which led to their current form of government. The wealthiest person in a city becomes mayor, and joins the other mayors on a council that governs the nation. Sparsely populated and with few natural resources, Thesk has avoided the conquering gaze of the Red Wizards and is instead a reliable trade partner for food and exotic goods brought in on the Golden Way. Thesk suffered greatly from the attacks of the Tuigan horde, because the nomads used the well-trod road to attack several cities in quick succession.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Although the horde was defeated, Thesk was disrupted for years by the presence of refugees of the Tuigan attacks. The thousand orc soldiers left behind by the Zhentarim added to their paranoia, for orcs had not been seen in that region for hundreds of years, and some considered them demons. The Shadowmasters of Telflamm bribed and coerced the orcs to resettle away from their city. After being rebuffed by the druids of the Forest of Lethyr, the orcs settled peacefully in and around Phsant, where the locals eventually grew to accept them, particularly in light of their actions in helping defeat the Tuigan horde a few miles from that city.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.kdajq5avh9v6"><span class="c6">Plots and Rumors</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Unlike Rashemen or Thay, which are eastern lands that do not welcome adventurers, the folk of Thesk celebrate anyone who makes their land safer by driving out monsters. They might also welcome anyone willing to contest the power of the Shadowmasters.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Old Soldiers: Now that the Zhentarim have control of most of the Moonsea, they are looking to their remote agents in an effort to establish a firmer foothold in the rest of the world. In Thesk, these agents are the thousand orcs from their army. However, in the twelve years since arriving here, the orcs have adjusted to living in this region, and few have any interest in returning to a situation where they have to risk their lives for someone else&#39;s grand plans. The Zhents may try to woo the orcs back with money or capture them by force of arms.</span></p><h1 class="c14" id="h.p1p8v8rznk2t"><span class="c20">Thay</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Best known for the crimson-robed Red Wizards who rule the land with an iron fist; Thay is a realm shrouded in mystery. Few outsiders have traveled extensively within its borders unless abducted and sold into a short life of slavery there: The Thayans who do talk about their homeland speak of it with such pride as to make most listeners doubt their amazing claims - were it not for the fact that these same rumors surface again and again from a dozen different sources.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Thayans have endeavored constantly to expand their borders since they won their independence from Mulhorand in 922 DR. In fact, it was only twelve years after that momentous date that the Thayans launched their first invasion of Rashemen. The Thayans have been beaten back numerous times from both Aglarond and Rashemen, but though their armies failed to subjugate these realms, they still brought the Alaor, the Priador, the Sur and Umber vales, and the cities of the Wizards&#39; Reach under Thay&#39;s control.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The borders of Thay have changed little since the conquest of the Wizards&#39; Reach fifteen years ago. The Red Wizards keep their armies at home these days, while their merchants have spread throughout the lands of the Inner Sea, selling valuable magic items in well protected concessions and Thayan enclaves. Rivers of gold, goods, and slaves pour into the zulkirs&#39; coffers from this expansion of Thayan trade. Szass Tam and his colleagues have come to understand that gold can conquer lands that resist swords and spells, and Thay&#39;s monopoly on the manufacture and sale of magic items might be the weapon that brings the Red Wizards dominion over all Faer&ucirc;n.</span></p><h2 class="c33 c19" id="h.6yzw2jeumt5n"><span class="c23 c32">Geographic Overview</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The country of Thay, once a large portion of the Mulhorandi Empire, extends from the borders of Thesk and Aglarond in the west to the Sunrise Mountains in the east. It stretches nearly 500 miles from north to south and 450 miles from east to west. Rashemen is directly to the north, across Lake Mulsantir, while the Alamber Sea arid Mulhorand form Thay&#39;s southern edge.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Most of Thay consists of a great plateau almost 350 miles across. These arid tablelands are about 2,000 feet above sea level at the outer edges and slope up to an elevation of about 4,000 feet in the vicinity of Lake Thaylambar and the foothills of the Sunrise Mountains. The plateau&#39;s southern, western, and northern borders are a band of broken cliffs and rugged canyons known as the First Escarpment. While few of these cliffs are more than a couple of hundred feet in height, the Escarpment rises on a dozen or so such precipices in the space of ten or fifteen miles, like the tiers of a wedding cake. A small party on foot can pick their way up the Escarpment over a day or two of difficult paths and short scrambles, but an army of any size is limited to a small number of passes and roads, which the Thayans guard well.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Atop the Plateau of Thay, the land consists of broad, rolling vistas broken by low mesas and chains of jagged rocks. Within its bounds rises the Ruthammar Plateau, a second, smaller plateau roughly 150 miles in diameter, which is more often referred to as the Thaymount (its most prominent feature) or High Thay. The Second Escarpment, a chain of cliffs and gorges even more forbidding than the First Escarpment, bounds High Thay. It averages almost 6,000 feet in elevation and is noticeably colder and more arid than the tablelands below</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">At the center of High Thay stand the volcanic peaks of Thaymount, in actuality a hundred-mile chain of fanglike ridges and smoldering cinder cones whose highest point is more than 17,000 feet high. In the youth of the world, basalt flows from these now-slumbering giants formed the mighty plateaus of Thay. While a number of people live in High Thay, few settlements stand close to the peaks of the Thaymount - minor eruptions are common, creating ash falls and clouds of sulfurous fumes that drift northeast, rendering a large area of the plateau virtually uninhabitable.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">At the eastern edge of the country, amid the foothills of the Sunrise Mountains, rises a third series of cliffs - the Surague Escarpment. This forms a shelf atop the First Escarpment, and like the plateau of High Thay, averages about 6,000 feet in elevation. Numerous streams spill down from the heights of the Sunrise Mountains, creating a tangled maze of gorges and canyonlands in this corner of the country.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Just east of High Thay, near the eastern foot of the Second Escarpment, lies Lake Thaylambar. Fed by the River Surag, born of the snowmelts of the Sunrise Mountains, this deep, cold body of water is nearly eighty miles. across. Its outlet is the River Thay, which flows north to Lake Mulsantir near the Surmarsh. The Sunrise Mountains also give rise to two other great rivers - the Thazarim in the south and the Gauros in the north. The soot-covered glaciers of the Thaymount feed two more great rivers - the Umber, which flows west to Aglarond and the Sea of Dlurg, and the Lapendrar, with flows southwest through the Priador to meet the Wizards&#39; Reach at Escalant.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay is a naturally warm, dry land whose lofty elevation prevents the moisture laden winds from the Sea of Fallen Stars from bringing much precipitation to the interior. Never ones to be satisfied with their lot, the Red Wizards have created a network-of spells that maintains pleasant weather conditions all year round, This plays havoc with the weather in Thesk, but the Thayans do not concern themselves with the difficulties of their neighbors. The days are warm but not unpleasantly so. The plains are regularly soaked with rains, but only in the dead of night, just about every day in Thay is a fine one, in stark contrast to the miserable lives most people lead here. The weather spells ensure fine growing conditions for vast croplands, worked by the uncounted thousands of slaves upon whom the Thayan economy depends.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 804.00px;"><img alt="map" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 804.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h2 class="c33 c19" id="h.vieuj880rnc5"><span class="c23 c32">Major Geographic Features</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay is blessed with many special natural features, from the glaciers and volcanoes of the Thaymount to the beaches of Bezantur. Those traveling along one of the few main roads are treated to breath-taking views as they mount first one escarpment and then another. The distant snow-covered peaks of the Thaymount seem to watch over it all like sleeping kings, a landmark visible from almost any spot in the country.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Most travelers enter Thay through one of five major routes. In the north, those following the Golden Way come first to the port city of Surthay on the southern shore of Lake Mulsantir. Traditionally, travelers ride or walk the Long Portage from Surthay up to the top of the Plateau of Thay. The River Thay is one of the, great highways of the land, and slave-pulled barges ferry goods and passengers from the First Escarpment to Lake Thaylambar. Once on the lake, it&#39;s an easy voyage to Eltabbar, the capital city, located on the south-western shore.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In the southeast, travelers forge, their way up the River Thazarim to the First Escarpment. An old Mulhorandi road leads through the gorge of the Thazarim and meets a track bound for Pyarados. From there, one can either take the path along the Sunrise Mountains to Lake Thaylambar, or go by the well-maintained Eastern Way to Tyraturos, then north along the High Road to Eltabbar. Few people enter Thay by this route, as the tharch of Thazalhar is a desolate and forbidding land, plagued by restless undead and hungry monsters from the mountains.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Most people bound for Thay put in at the great port of Bezantur, one of the largest cities along the Sea of Fallen Stars. The High Road leads straight north through Tyraturos to Eltabbar. The Thayans expect visitors to enter by this route, so inns and taverns catering to foreigners are common along the High Road - as are spies and agents of the Red Wizards, who keep a close eye on folk of other, lands.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In the past, armies seeking to invade Thay have come by way of the River Lapendrar. The Lapendrar itself is not navigable past the First Escarpment, as a waterfall tumbles over the edge of the Plateau of Thay, preventing passage. However, the gorge of the River of Sorrows is one of the broadest and most gentle ascents of the First Escarpment, at least for travelers on foot. When Halacar of Aglarond led his ill-advised expedition into Thay a century ago, this was the route he chose.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Lastly, some prefer to sail up the River Umber to Nethjet, located on the eastern side of Lake Umber. From here, one can follow the Eastern Way until it. meets up with the High Road at Tyratturos, then head north to Eltabbar. Monsters haunting the passage through the Dragonjaw Mountains make this route somewhat dangerous, and the Nethjet end of the Eastern Way is poorly maintained, a magnet for gnoll brigands and similar undesirables. Folk from northerly lands along the Inner Sea find this a faster but more dangerous route than the long walk up the Golden Way to Mulsantir and Surthay.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In addition to the natural defenses of Thay, a number of small citadels sprinkle the slopes of both. the First and Second Escarpments. These well-built stone structures ostensibly keep out enemies, but in truth, they are home to patrols of humans and gnolls who spend more of their time keeping Thayan slaves in. Most roads on the Plateau itself (especially the Eastern Way and the High Road) are impeccably maintained. Raised a, few feet above the surrounding land, they are covered with an alchemical tarmac for durability and ease of use. Work crews constantly repair the roads, keeping them in near-perfect shape. Small fortresses known as tax stations line the roads and appear at all other points of entry into Thay.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.f2hjoin6c2nz"><span class="c23 c10">Tax Stations</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay is filled with these small fortresses. Each houses a garrison of thirty to fifty gnoll or human warriors, ready to put teeth into the implied threat each visitor faces when accosted by the tax collectors.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Tax stations stand not only at the edges of Thay, but also at the border of each tharch and at every other point along which people are likely to pass. The revenues collected help to fund the tharchs, one of the reasons for Thay&#39;s excellent public services. Taxes vary greatly from tharch to tharch, not to mention from station to station. They are rarely exorbitant, as the tharchions don&#39;t wish to discourage traffic through their territories. The amount ranges from as little as 2 cp to as much as 1 gp. Guards also check for passes or traveling permits while they collect the coins, and folk abroad without the proper documentation are usually jailed on the spot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The tax stations also keep the slave population under control. Few slaves have any money, and those who try to pose as Thayan citizens are sure to run into problems without cash. The fees may not be that high, but they must be paid. The station&#39;s soldiers do their utmost to make tax evaders see the error of their ways.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.upzy2qh8gg3s"><span class="c6">The Alaar</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Alaar comprises two islands off the southern coast of Thay, where the Wizards&#39; Reach meets the Alamber Sea. While this is the smallest of the eleven tharchs, its position makes it one of the most vital. The bulk of the Thayan navy is housed here, along with the primary Thayan shipyards. The principal harbor of the Alaor is an expansive cove guarded by a sea-arch. In the rock of the headlands lies a network of sea caves large enough to hide an entire, fleet. The rugged islands have no other good landing spots or sheltered bays, which is one reason no other country thought to use them as a naval base.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Tharchion Thessaloni Canos (LE female human Ftr17) commands the tharch; the evoker Mur Vhol (N male human Evo7/Red5) assists her, supervising the various magelings assigned to the tharchion&#39;s fleet. Over 15,000 souls call this tharch home, including sailors. The fleet consists of a dozen slender, deadly dromonds, powerful galleys each crewed by over one hundred well-armed warriors and twice that number of slave rowers. Each warship carries a pair of Thayan bombards, as well as a ship&#39;s mage and a ship&#39;s acolyte - a wizard and a cleric specializing in battle magic. The pride of the Thayan navy - a massive warship known as the Red Scourge - lies at anchor here when not escorting Thayan merchant ships in and out of the area. Most pirates flee at the first sight of the ship&#39;s crimson-colored sails, for they know that to confront such a powerful vessel is to invite a swift and sorcerous death. Altogether, the fleet is crewed by almost 5,000 officers, soldiers, and slaves; most of the remaining folk who call this barren island home are carpenters, stevedores, provisioners, sailmakers, shipwrights, and all the other artisans and professionals needed to maintain a fleet in port.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">With the advent of Thay as a mercantile power, the Alaor has become even more vital to the nation&#39;s interests. The Thayan navy had long worked to keep the waters of the Sahuagin Sea (as the Alamber Sea is also called) free of pirates. They\ have since extended their operations to include a good stretch of the Wizards&#39; Reach. Between the forces of Thay and Aglarond, there are few safe places for pirates to operate in this region. Several naval ships have even been converted into mercantile vessels carrying Thay&#39;s goods to the rest of the world. Merchant ships from Bezantur carry much of Thay&#39;s trade to other lands, but shipments to and from major enclaves are entrusted only to Thay&#39;s navy. The Alaor is well defended. The zulkirs know the islands are Thay&#39;s first line of defense against an invasion by sea. If the islands were to fall into a foreign power&#39;s hands, the results would be disastrous. Any foe who had control over such a base could attack up and down the southern coast of Thay with impunity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Besides the garrison of 1,000 soldiers on duty here at all times, the islands are outfitted with dozens of batteries of Thayan bombards.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.tpnyn7otubh2"><span class="c6">Delhumide</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Once the most populous district of old Thay in the days of Mulhorandi rule, the tharch of Delhumide is now thinly settled. Stretching from Lake Thaylambar to the Gorge of Gauros and bounded on the east and west by the River Thay and the River Gauros, Delhumide is a broad land of open plains and few people. The tharch could easily support a much greater population, except that demons, ghosts, and sleeping spells of deadly malevolence taint the countryside for miles around the ruins of the old capital and the province&#39;s abandoned estates.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">With the exception of some farmland along the river valleys, Delhumide is mostly used as open range for large herds of cattle. Tharchion Invarri Metron (LE male human Ftr11). governs the land from his palace at Umratharos, a small city at the bend of the River Thay. He has little interest in the ruins of the old capital but is happy to collect a cut of any wealth recovered by adventurers picking through the wreckage.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.1gbfayjej73w"><span class="c6">Eltabbar</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Northwest Thay belongs to the tharch of Eltabbar, a curving swath of land that extends from the western shores of Lake Thaylambar and around the northern slopes of the Second Escarpment all the way to the River Umber, almost directly opposite the city of Eltabbar. Even though Thay&#39;s capital city is located in this tharch, large portions of it are lightly populated - most of the land between the rich valley of the River Thay and the Umber is scrubland, home to the roaming bands of gnolls and orcs who make up the julkirs&#39; foot soldiers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The tharchion of Eltabbar is the notorious Dmitra Flass (NE female human Ill7/Red8), the so-called First Princess of Thay. She spends all her time in the capital and gives little thought to anything that happens on the northwest frontier. The wreckage of old Nar ruins dot the remoter portions of the tharch, occasionally disgorging some forgotten demon that terrorizes the countryside until bound or destroyed by the Red Wizards.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.lhhrv3vzxpiw"><span class="c6">Gauros</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Gauros is a relatively poor tharch with no major cities. The River Gauros flows down from the heights of the Sunrise Mountains and through northeastern Thay before tumbling over the edge of the First Escarpment to carve out the great Gorge of Gauros. From there, it flows into Lake Mulsantir on the nation&#39;s northern border.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Gauros is rocky, rugged, and forbidding, a wild land of dry pine forests and high, barren mesas. Swift, shallow snow-melt rivers from the Sunrises rush- through the land, but by midsummer they are reduced to dusty rivulets. Most of the folk in the district are Rashemi woodcutters and goatherds. Ruined towers and empty keeps crown many of the barren hills, the remnants of ancient Raumathar&#39;s foothold on this part of the Thayan plateau. The nearby mountains harbor dangerous monsters, including athachs, chimeras, and bands of feral gnolls.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The ruler of Gauros is Tharch Azhir Kren (NE female human Ftr15). An aggressive general, she is itching to lead Szass Tam&#39;s legions into battle. The zulkir&#39;s fascination with developing trade does nothing but frustrate her. Kren&#39;s troops constantly patrol the Gorge of Gauros, looking for any excuse to launch an invasion of her nation&#39;s northern neighbor, Rashemen. Kren only needs the thinnest of pretexts, and if she doesn&#39;t stumble across one soon, she&#39;ll manufacture the necessary evidence.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.s73mxv2crfzm"><span class="c23 c10">Daggertooth Pass</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">One of only two passes through the Sunrise Mountains, Daggertooth Pass follows the Gauros up to its headwaters and crosses a high saddle to come down in the upper vale of the Murghol, a tributary to the Clearfiow of the Endless Wastes. To one side of the main track a knife-like peak looms, the mountain that gives the pass its name. The top of the pass is a little more than 9,000 feet above sea level, and heavy snows linger on the shaded northern-sides of the peaks all year long. In some years, the Daggertooth is completely impassable. The narrow and steep track is unsuitable for anything approaching the size of an army, which is why the Tuigans have never troubled the Thayans by this route. The zulkirs maintain a sinister fortress called Chur-Gathos a little way down from the saddle on the Thayan side. This cold, lonely outpost is reserved for those soldiers unlucky enough to earn a posting in one of the worst spots in the land.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.pdfi2hy18xqb"><span class="c23 c10">Gorge of Gauros</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Well over 100 miles in length, the Gorge of Gauros cleaves the First Escarpment in a maze of deep, narrow canyons, dividing the plateau of Thay from the Mulsanyaar Plateau in Rashemen. Here the river Gauros joins a number of smaller streams racing down from the heights of the Sunrise Mountains. The northeast corner of the Plateau of Thay is more than 4,000 feet above sea level, and the Mulsantir basin has an elevation of about 1,500 feet, so the gorge averages half a mile or more in depth. It is about twenty miles wide for most of its length, its floor divided by numerous side-canyons, nameless cascades, and crumbling plinths of rock scoured by ancient floodwaters.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Gorge of Gauros blocks all north and south travel east of Lake Mulsantir, except for a narrow strip along the foot of the escarpment right by the lake shore. It is one of Rashemen&#39;s most effective defenses against Thayan attack. The gorge is home to a number of monsters, including a very old female red dragon named Magrevystala, who lairs in a dry hanging valley somewhere in its heart.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.gqry3zbe4uvj"><span class="c6">High Thay</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Also known as the Plateau of Ruthammar or (mistakenly) the Thaymount, High Thay is that portion of the country above the Second Escarpment and below the Thaymount proper. Little is known of this land outside of Thay: Foreigners are not permitted to travel there except under the direct escort of a Red Wizard, and the Red Wizards do not bring outsiders to this portion of their land without very good cause.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">While the center of High Thay is dominated by the ice-clad volcanoes of the Thaymount, a ring of cool, fertile highlands surround the smoking mountains. This higher plateau is only a dozen miles wide on its eastern side, but in other places it is a broad; lightly forested highland almost 100 miles across. Like the Plateau of Thay below, the land consists of low mesas separated by broad, rolling plains, but High Thay is cooler and more humid than the lands below and supports pine forests, vineyards, and great orchards of fruit trees. High Thay climbs steeply upward as one travels toward the Thaymount, and the foothills could be called mountains in any other land. For centuries, High Thay has been the refuge of the land&#39;s masters. Mulan noble families, high clerics of the faiths of Bane, Cyric, or Kossuth, and of course prominent Red Wizards own vast estates on this high plateau. The Thayans do not build great cities here, although a number of well-ordered towns populate the southern and western regions of the plateau. Most of these powerful Thayans are absentee landlords, spending their time in the cities of greater Thay and only retreating to their estates to escape the late-summer heat of the lower plateau.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Portions of High Thay, particularly the foothills and the northerly and eastern reaches downwind of the Thaymount, are quite barren, covered with ash falls from the volcanoes. These lands are unsettled except for the occasional Red Wizard determined to raise a tower in a particularly desolate spot. Wild gnolls, orcs, and other humanoids haunt these lands, mostly because the Red Wizards find them useful stock for their armies and have not made any concerted effort to exterminate them.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.hdiww3xx60y3"><span class="c6">Lapendrar</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Hezass Nymar (NE male human Clr8 of Kossuth) is the tharchion of Lapendrar. This tharch begins at the southeastern edge of the Second Escarpment and rolls, down to the borders of Thesk and Aglarond. This territory features many important cities, including Nethentir, Nethjet, Amruthar, and Escalant. The River Umber flows through this territory before reaching Aglarond, while the River Lapendrar forms the tharch&#39;s southern border until it empties into the Wizards&#39; Reach. The Eastern Way, one of the two major roads connecting the southern portions of Thay, bisects this tharch.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Lapendrar is one of the least strongly held of all the tharchs. Its border with Aglarond is constantly disputed, an its largest city, Amruthar, is nominally independent of Thay. This suits Nymar, who craftily maintains a compassionate and generous manner unknown in the other tharchs. Many of his fellows condemn Nymar as a well-connected weakling, but in truth he is a master of treachery - most of his victims don&#39;t even realize it was he who orchestrated their downfall. Nymar rules his tharch from an elegant palace of white marble in the city of Escalant (the most recent addition to the Thayan Empire) although he spends much of his time in Eltabbar, scheming against his peers.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.w4pz5mcgnq3f"><span class="c6">Plateau of Thay</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Plateau of Thay includes everything within the First Escarpment, a long line of sheer cliffs surrounding the interior portion of the country, although the lands above the Second Escarpment - High Thay and the Thaymount - are distinctly different. The distance between the First and Second Escarpments ranges from little more than twenty miles on the western edge overlooking Nethentir to nearly 200 miles in the southeast and northeast reaches.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The First Escarpment guards Thay from attack and has daunted many who contemplated invasion. The natural walls are a better defense than any army. The cliffs are honey-combed with tunnels, barracks, and fortresses carved directly into the rock, highlighting the difficulty of challenging Thay on its own turf. In fact, the escarpment was one of the reasons the wizards of Thay were able to fight off their Mulhorandi overlords during their war of independence. Even though the Thayans were disorganized and divided by vicious feuds, the Mulhorandi army had a devil of a time getting up and over those cliffs.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The plateau itself is a naturally arid, rolling plain with occasional dusty mesas. Centuries ago, the Red Wizards crafted great weather-controlling spells to bring rain and moderate temperatures to this upland, and now vast tracts of former savanna are densely cultivated cropland. In the southern reaches of the plateau, every bit of land is put to use. Slaves tend the fields and orchards, planting and harvesting crops, felling timber, and picking fruit. Cotton and grain are the major crops, although citrus and olive trees and the occasional vineyard grow between the fields. Tax stations and the estates of noble Thayans and Red Wizards dot the land, along with small villages that sprout up around them. North of the Second Escarpment, the plateau is much less densely populated. The valleys of the rivers Gauros and Thay are heavily settled, but much of the rest is empty scrubland, inhabited only by goatherds, shepherds, and stonecutters.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Nearly 3 1/2 million people live on the Plateau of Thay. Of these, about 2 1/2 million are slaves or the evil humanoids who guard them (mostly gnolls and orcs). Both slaves and warriors live in squalor in massive barracks. The Thayan economy depends on slaves, a constantly replenished source of cheap labor who are routinely worked to death under the watchful eyes of cruel overseers and guards.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Thayan merchant fleet ships surplus cotton, grain, olive oil, and citrus fruit all across eastern Faer&ucirc;n. Thayan grain feeds Impiltur, Chessenta, and the Vast, as well as the cities of the Wizards&#39; Reach. The success of this trade led to the current strategy of exporting more valuable goods - namely, magic items - to other lands. Thayan merchants already knew the trade routes and had demonstrated for decades that Thay could be a successful trading partner.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The entire plateau is impervious to scrying magic. The Red Wizards have set up an elaborate shield of overlapping wards that prevent such spying. Any spell with the scrying descriptor that targets a person or point within the First Escarpment fails automatically. Divination of other types usually works, but many Red Wizards screen their activities with additional defenses such as mind blank or nondetection. These wards interfere with the Red Wizards&#39; own scrying spells as well, making it difficult for them to magically locate intruders. However, the patrols usually do a good job of watching.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Guards both human and gnoll patrol the plateau in the settled areas, on the lookout for escaped slaves and foreign spies. Despite the opening of trade agreements with many nations, few foreigners spend much time in the Thayan countryside. Most are issued passes permitting travel to only one or two cities along a specified route.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.d4kp84vk1x11"><span class="c23 c10">Lake Thaylambar</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Lake Thaylambar is the largest body of fresh water within Thay&#39;s borders. It is wide, deep, and always cold, even in th middle of summer. Its waters feed the River Thay, which flows north to empty into Lake Mulsantir. Eltabbar - the capital of Thay, sits on the southwestern shore of Lake Thaylambar. Delhumide, the original provincial capital, once looked out from the northeastern shore, but it was destroyed in Thay&#39;s war of independence.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The fishing in Lake Thaylambar is wonderful. Large amounts of seafood from its depths find their way onto plates throughout the nation. The lake is not without dangers, though. Its depths are infested with dragon turtles that sometimes like to snack on fishing vessels. Over the years, the zulkirs have sent out hunting parties to thin their numbers, with limited success. Although these expeditions sometimes manage to find and kill dragon turtles, the hunters often become the hunted. On occasion, expeditions have been completely wiped out.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">However, last year one group of hunters managed to capture a dragon turtle alive. Brazhal Kos (LE male human Enc7/Red4), a powerful enchanter, devised a magic harness that enslaved the creature to his will. Kos has offered its services to Homen Odesseiron, the tharchion of Surthay. Assuming the Red Wizards can transport the creature, this would put the captive dragon turtle in Lake Mulsantir to contest Rashemi control of the lake. Brazhal Kos makes this offer expecting something in return, of course.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.k1gwopjchcje"><span class="c23 c10">River Thay</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">From Lake Thaylambar, the River Thay flows north toward Surthay and Lake Mulsantir, marking the boundary between the tharchs of Delhumide and Eltabbar. The vale of the Thay is heavily populated, a fertile plain supporting vast orchards of fruit trees more suited to cool weather than the citrus groves of the south, such as apples and cherries. The river itself is the principal highway to the northern marches of Thay, and numerous keelboats and barges ply its waters, towed by slave teams along the banks.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.gvbqkg5d3juu"><span class="c6">Priador</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Tharchion Aznar Thrul, the zulkir of evocation, rules this tharch with an iron fist. Thay&#39;s trade enclaves in other lands brings immense wealth into Bezantur, the tharch&#39;s largest city. Thrul has almost unlimited resources at his disposal, and there is little to stop him - other than the other zulkirs, that is. Thrul derided the notion of selling magic items early on when Thay was establishing the enclave system, so he has reaped little of the enormous profits of the Guild of Foreign Trade. The zulkir simmers over the lost opportunity. He believes a hefty cut of the Guild&#39;s take is due him as the tharchion controlling Bezantur, and he is considering how to claim his portion against the interest of those who supported the idea from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Priador extends along Thay&#39;s southern coast, from the River Lapendrar all the way east to the River Thazarim. It northern boundary is the Lapendrar and the First Escarpment. Along with the Alaor and Surthay in the distant north, the Priador is not actually part of the Plateau of Thay. Besides Bezantur, the tharch holds two other major settlements. Thasselen lies on the shore seventy miles west of Bezantur. Another hundred miles or so farther in that direction squats the port city of Murbant. Both of these ports are closer to the Sea of Fallen Stars - and therefore the bulk of Faer&ucirc;n - than Bezantur, but they are poor sisters to the tharch&#39;s capital. Bezantur is one of the largest and wealthiest cities in eastern Faer&ucirc;n, and its port is thronged with the ships of a dozen lands at all times.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The High Road, one of the nation&#39;s two major roads, starts in Bezantur. From there, it climbs the Firsts Escarpment, passes through Tyraturos, and ends in Eltabbar. Some of the locals call this road the Slave Way, for large numbers of slave are driven north along it to the markets of Eltabbar.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Unlike most of Thay, much of the Priador is still wild. In fact, a number of preserves throughout the region permit monsters to roam freely. These creatures are kept on hand for use in the Red Wizards&#39; unethical experiments. Travelers accosted by the creatures are allowed to defend themselves, but more than one monster-slayer has discovered that damaging a zulkir&#39;s property brings more pain than claws and teeth.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.dzywkv5jc2d2"><span class="c6">Pyrados</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The tharch of Pyarados runs between the eastern edge of Lake Thaylambar and the Sunrise Mountains, right to the lower portion of the River Thazarim and the southern edge of the First Escarpment. The tharch doesn&#39;t quite reach the High Road to the west, which is part of Tyraturos. The ruler of this tharch is Nymia Focar (CE female human Ftr9). Pyrados hasn&#39;t benefited directly from the influx of wealth brought about by the zulkirs&#39; new trade policy, but Focar has been savvy enough to make herself rich through her own initiatives. She is more forgiving of the presence of foreign adventurers than most of her peers, granting them free rein to explore those portions of the Sunrise Mountains that lie within her tharch. The only catch is that the shops in Pyarados charge foreigners triple the normal prices and pass the bulk of the profits back to the tharchion.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In addition to monster dens and old ruins, this part of the Sunrise Mountains harbors all sorts of mineral wealth. Foscar can&#39;t be bothered with owning or operating mines herself, so she charges a stiff tax on those who do. Any who try to cheat her or refuse to pay find their claims sold out from under them to people more willing to go along with Focar&#39;s demands.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">There is only one major city here - Pyarados, after which the tharch is named. Situated on the west bank of the River Thazarim, this is where the Eastern Way ends, just shy of the Surague Escarpment. Two well-worn tracks lead out of city. One follows the edges of the Surague Escarpment and the edge of Lake Thaylambar up to the city of Eltabbar. The other is on the east side of the River Thazarim, and it leads south through the tharch of Thazalhar into Mulhorand, eventually winding up in either Sultim or Rauthil, depending on which fork one follows.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.gf1obl3z30m6"><span class="c23 c10">The Pass of Thazar</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">A short distance north and east of the city of Pyarados is the Pass of Thazar, one of only two ways (Daggertooth Pass is th other) across the Sunrise Mountains into Thay. The pass climbs along the vale of the Thazarim River. At the top of the valley, a difficult road of switchbacks and precipitous drops snakes under the crest of the mountains for about ten miles before dropping into the upper vale of the Copper River, a tributary of the Clearfiow. A great stone wall raised centuries ago guards the top of the pass.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Thazar is lower and easier than the Daggertooth, but it is not as strategically important. Most travelers to Mulhorand or Murgh&ocirc;m simply take the road south from Pyarados to Rauthil. In the ancient wars against Mulhorand, the Pass of Thazar was much more important, as it offered an eastern approach to Thay, but little of consequence has happened here in a long time.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.j84790aq4sw8"><span class="c23 c10">Surague Escarpment</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Like the First and Second Escarpments, the Surague is a long line of steeply layered precipices climbing from the Plateau of Thay toward the Sunrise Mountains. It is much more broken and rugged than the other escarpments, sometimes vanishing entirely for dozens of miles before reappearing. Most of the Surague (the land above the escarpment) is at an elevation of about 6,000 to 7,000 feet and quickly merges with the steep foothills, and sheer peaks of the Sunrise range. The Thayans maintain few watchposts or fortresses along this frontier, since the Sunrises are virtually impassable to any but skilled mountaineers who know where they&#39;re going. Slaves hoping to escape into the mountains usually meet a quick end from the arduous conditions or the hungry monsters that plague the high vales. A few ragged bands of escaped slaves eke\ out a hardscrabble existence in the lower slopes, fleeing the approach of Thayan forces and raiding down onto the plateau when they dare. From time to time Thayan nobles organize expeditions to hunt these wretches for sport.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.1n6duggxcn1k"><span class="c6">Sunrise Mountains</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Sunrise Mountains, which many consider to mark the eastern end of Faer&ucirc;n proper, run all the way from the center of Rashemen to just past the southeastern border of Thay. They form the entirety of Thay&#39;s eastern border, towering almost 15,000 feet above sea level. To get to the Thayan portion of the Sunrise Mountains, a traveler must first tackle the Surague Escarpment. Few find even this to be worthwhile, as the Sunrises themselves are virtually impassable to those on foot. As well, the lands above the Surague Escarpment are wild and untended, nothing like the civilized plains of the First Escarpment. They are teeming with dangerous animals and hostile humanoids. From time to time, scouts from the goblin and kobold tribes living here forage into Thay proper. Every now and then, the tharchions of Surthay, Gauros, Pyrados, and Thazalhar send an expedition into the peaks. Old Raumviran towers and strongholds lie buried under the snows of the high slopes, as well as the ancient well-like fortresses of some even older people now forgotten by time. High and perilous passes cross the mountains at Daggertooth and Thazar, but there have long been rumors of a secret passage through the deeps into the Endless Wastes beyond. If this could be found and secured, it might divert the trade of the Golden Way south to Thay and increase tenfold the power of the tharchion whose people discovered the pass.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Scouts and adventurers have so far failed to discover such a way through, despite centuries of searching. The dangers of the mountains multiply the farther one descends from the surface. The caverns beneath the Sunrise mountains are filled with horrible creatures, including nagas, chimeras, and things unspeakably worse.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The patrols along this edge of Thay are not as alert as those of the nation&#39;s other borders. The denizens of the mountains rarely descend the Surague Escarpment to attack, and the idea of invading force coming through the mountains is preposterous. Border patrol here is considered one of the dullest and most miserable jobs a soldier can get, so it often draws the less ambitious of Thay&#39;s defenders. No one ever became a tharchion on such duty, after all.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.nzeykph4phyx"><span class="c6">Surthay</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Surthay is the northernmost of the tharchs. It stretches from the Surmarsh in the west to the Gorge of Gauros in the east, and it encompasses all Thayan land from the northern edge of the First Escarpment. down to Lake Mulsantir. Surthay was originally Thay&#39;s first line of defense against invasion from Rashemen, but over the years, it&#39;s become the springboard for attacks against the &quot;barbarians&quot; to the north.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">While the Surmarsh is technically within this tharch, Tharchion Homen Odesseiron (LE male human Evo6/Red1/Ftr12) doesn&#39;t bother with it much. As long as the marsh&#39;s lizardfolk don&#39;t cross the River Thay, they are fine where they are. Odesseiron gave up membership in the Red Wizards to pursue a military career years ago, but he is not as foolishly aggressive as Tharchion Kren of Gauros. Kren often pushes Odesseiron to join her in launching an attack against Rashemen, despite the orders of the zulkirs. So far, Odesseiron has not been persuaded of the wisdom in that act, although he allows Kren to move her troops through Surthay on the pretext of &quot;military exercises.&quot;</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.sxbp036c73te"><span class="c23 c10">The Long Portage</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The River Thay cuts through the middle of the tharch on its way from Lake Thaylambar to Lake Mulsantir below. It&#39;s impossible to navigate past the point where the river tumbles down the First Escarpment. However, there is a long tradition of portaging boats and goods up the escarpment, where a ship can then work its way upriver to Lake Thaylambar and the port at Eltabbar. The Guild of Portagers used to charge outrageous prices to move goods, three hundred or more years ago. The Red Wizards of the time grew frustrated with the arrangement - homicidally So. They killed most of the portagers and animated them as zombies.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">To this day, tireless zombies handle the grunt work of portaging. Although they can be clumsy, they are also obedient, and they never steal from their masters or their clients. And, unlike traditional slaves, they don&#39;t have to be fed, clothed, or permitted to rest.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.p71m3g90innx"><span class="c23 c10">The Surmarsh</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Surmarsh is a wide, fetid swamp on the southern shore of the western end of Lake Mulsantir, at the point where the River Sur flows into the lake. This cold and dreary place lies beyond the effects of the Red Wizards&#39; weather magic and is exposed to seemingly endless rains as the cold air of Ashanath and Rashemen meets the warm, stationary air mass artificially maintained over the Plateau of Thay. Fierce thunderstorms even in the depths of winter are not uncommon here. The Surmarsh swarms with tribes of lizardfolk. These primitive humanoids spend most of their energies struggling with one another for supremacy over this soggy piece of land. Some Red Wizards think the lizardfolk may be the descendants of the serpent-people who built the Citadel, an ancient fortress buried beneath the highest peak in the Thaymount. If that is true, a once-proud folk have fallen a long, hard way.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Almost all the tribes here have a treaty of some sort with the Red Wizards. The lizardfolk agree not to bother the Thayans of the region, and the Red Wizards promise not to annihilate the lizardfolk. The treaty specifically does not apply to foreigners wandering through, whom the lizardfolk capture or kill and turn over to the next Thayan patrol. This is usually rewarded with a bounty of 10 gp worth of food per captive or corpse.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The lizardfolk of the Surmarsh consider it a great honor to be drafted into any Thayan armed force. Many have proudly served in the distant Umber Marshes during numerous campaigns against Aglarond. Thayan nobles sometimes enter the Surmarsh on hunting expeditions, employing the local lizard-folk as porters and guides. The swamp is infested with dangerous creatures, including ropers, otyughs, and beasts even more threatening. The prize trophy of the land is the head of a black dragon. A clan of the creatures lairs in the depths of the Surmarsh, and dragons are routinely spotted soaring high above the swamp. Finding such monsters is hard enough, and besting them is even more unlikely, but several parties of nobles give it a try every year just the same.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.uxyiri1h356o"><span class="c6">Thaymount</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Thaymount is a not a single peak but a chain of volcanic mountains in the middle of High Thay, the plateau above the Second Escarpment. Knifelike ridges of rock and smoldering cinder cones reach an altitude of more than 17,000 feet, and soot-covered glaciers cling to their upper slopes. Access to this region is restricted to Red Wizards and their guests - unauthorized visitors are executed on the spot.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Three rivers have their sources in Thaymount&#39;s ice-covered peaks. The River Umber runs west toward the Sea of Dlurg. The River Lapendrar flows south to the Wizards&#39; Reach, and the River Eltar pours east into Lake Thaylambar, the largest body of fresh water in the nation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Eltabbar may be the capital of Thay, but Thaymount is the nation&#39;s heart. Private fortresses of the most powerful Red Wizards are scattered across the smoking slopes like black stars in a fiery sky. Gold mines, volcanic forges, and the dark barracks of elite monstrous troops, as well as the magical workshops and armories of the Red Wizards, cluster around the foothills of the Thaymount. Many of the magic items created for export, along with deadlier devices the Red Wizards keep for their own use, come from these forbidding factories.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The troops here - mostly gnolls, blood orcs, darkenbeasts, and other evil creatures - number in the thousands. They stand ready to be launched in any direction their masters send them. The current peace has left these aggressive warriors restless for action. This pent-up violence has been painful for the few foolhardy souls who have trespassed in Thaymount over the past couple of years, as the creatures take out their frustrations on folk unfortunate enough to cross their paths.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Many of the Red Wizards&#39; fortresses contain laboratories for dangerous experiments in magically influenced breeding. The more promising results are sent out into the world to test their abilities, striking fear into all who encounter them. The greatest success so far has been the blood orcs, which have exceeded their creators&#39; wildest dreams. Now the Red Wizards have started trying the same techniques on members of other races to build even broader populations of creatures under their control.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Thaymount&#39;s peaks include a number of active volcanoes. Ash falls and pyroclastic flows are more common than lava fountains or explosive events. In recent years, the activity of the Thaymount has been increasing, giving rise to stories that demons imprisoned there before the founding of the realm may be close to escaping. The earthquake that shook Eltabbar a few years back broke the seals holding the demon prince Eltab under the city, and rumor has it that this creature was - or still is - behind the latest geological troubles too.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">What&#39;s not in doubt is that the Red Wizards are more agitated and secretive than usual. The sinister mages are spending a great deal of time and effort on constructing new fortifications around their keeps. Some are even working to connect their fortresses for mutual defense, something that was almost unheard of just a few years ago.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.k4gvtc52ki09"><span class="c6">Thazalhar</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thazalhar is the smallest of the tharchs outside of the islands of the Alaor. It covers much of the land between the River Thazarim and the River of Dawn. This gives Tharchion Milsantos Daramos (LN male human Ftr14) complete control over any land routes between Thay and Mulhorand. In the realm&#39;s earliest days, this tharch was a vital point of defense between Thay and its old master. For a long time after that, it was a launching point for Thayan troops rolling into Mulhorand. Today, it is a primary conduit of trade between the two formerly bitter enemies.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Daramos is the only one of the tharchions who is not evil, and it shows in the way he governs his territory. Many of the other tharchions - and even some of the zulkirs - think the old man has gotten soft in his later years. In fact, Daramos has never cared for killing, but he saw it as necessary to protect the interests of his people. He&#39;s thrilled with the growing success of the trade enclaves. A true patriot, Daramos hopes this method will finally allow the vicious Thayans to lay aside their differences and work together. He knows he is past his prime and has no chance of bringing the factions under a single banner, but perhaps Szass Tam has finally managed it, using money not to purchase weapons but as a weapon. No other land could possibly stand against the might of a united Thay.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thazalhar&#39;s main source of income is the bridge fees it charges to pass over the River of Dawn into Thay (1 sp each for Thayans and 10 gp each for everyone else). Some foreign merchants pay the fees, but many sell their goods at a cut rate to Thayans on the Mulhorandi side of the bridge, then turn around and go home again.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.n3a72fvumf3l"><span class="c6">Tyraturos</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The tharch of Tyraturos is literally the crossroads of Thay. The Eastern Way crosses the High Road at the city that gives the tharch its name. This makes Tyraturos a hotbed of merchant activity, particularly in the slave trade. Just about any kind of slave can be found for sale here, including exotic creatures like lamias, centaurs, and the normally indomitable drow. The tharchion here is a former priest of Waukeen by the name of Dimon (LN male human Clr7 of Bane) who converted to the worship of Bane soon after the return of the Black Lord. The rampant corruption of Thay led Dimon to the worship of tyranny as a way to impose order on the squabbling factions of his homeland.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Tyraturos is the third-largest city in Thay, which makes it as one observer noted, &quot;one of the filthiest and most unpleasant cities in a filthy and unpleasant land.&quot; Over 50,000 souls call this pit home, but that number can double during the high trade seasons of the spring and fall. While the city is not walled, it features a central citadel that houses a garrison of over 8,000 warriors who stand ready to quell any problems that may erupt. Here a traveler can purchase just about anything - or anyone - she could want. Contraband of all sorts used to be traded openly in Tyraturos, even though such crimes are punishable by a quick death. Before the tharchion&#39;s conversion, it was accepted practice to bribe any potential prosecutor, but Dimon has discovered a new zeal for law under the Black Lord, and he has put a stop to the corruption of his officers.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The tharchion taxes all goods moving along the great roads. Until recently, customs officials could be persuaded to be circumspect in their tax assessments, but under Dimon&#39;s new laws, they are no longer willing to accept such persuasion. After Dimon made public examples of both the briber and the recipient of the bribe by ordering both drawn and quartered, the merchants of the city have resigned themselves to paying up as a cost of doing business.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.szmdu8g3l8r"><span class="c6">River Umber</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Born in the Thaymount&#39;s high glaciers, the River Umber is a steep, swift torrent with many cascades in the first hundred miles of its length. At Nethentir, it spills out from its rapids along the First Escarpment into the placid waters of Lake Umber. From Lake Umber, the river is navigable all the way to the Sea of Dlurg, passing through a broad gap in the Dragonjaw Mountains.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Vessels cannot ascend the Umber past Nethentir, but from the twin towns on the lake, vessels regularly carry Thayan grain, fruit, and timber out to the Sea of Fallen Stars. The Aglarondans at Emmech grudgingly allow Thayan cargo vessels to pass unless Aglarond and Thay are at war, which has not been the case for several years now.</span></p><h1 class="c14" id="h.4a03cjh55ruy"><span class="c20">People of Thay</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay is a land of divisions, many of which determine a person&#39;s place in society and her access to power. While the vast majority of Thayans are human, there is a substantial humanoid population as well. Most of the non-humans are either slaves or warriors in the various armed forces of the Red Wizards, but some have earned their emancipation.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.l4hup5hcwqv5"><span class="c6">Races and Cultures</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Gnolls and orcs are the most common nonhuman humanoids in Thay. They form the backbone of the Thayan armies, especially the gnolls, who are often placed in city garrisons to keep the populace in line. The less-controllable orcs are usually employed as shock troops.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">With the zulkirs&#39; current policy of peaceful trade, the orcs often sit idle, itching for a fight of some sort. If one doesn&#39;t come quickly enough, they end up rioting among themselves. To keep this violence from overflowing into the rest of the population, the Red Wizards have set up a regular series of gladiatorial games. Orcs, gnolls, and other violent humanoids are pitted against one another in blood matches for the enjoyment of ever-growing crowds of spectators.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Goblins and halflings are also not uncommon in Thay, although they are almost always slaves. Their lives may not be as violent as those of the gnolls and orcs, but they are just as short. Tieflings and other planetouched creatures can be found here as well, although these rare folk are judged more by their human ancestry than their physical appearance.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In addition to the non-humans, Thay is home to two distinct human cultures: the Rashemi and the Mulan.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.rfs6lwkcu362"><span class="c23 c10">Mulan</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Mulhorandi blood runs thick in the veins of the Mulan. These are the descendants of renegades who rebelled against the Mulhorandi Empire 400 years ago, and since those fateful days, they have retained the power they wrested from their distant masters. Nearly all the Red Wizards are of Mulan extraction. There are a few exceptions, and most of these pass themselves off as the children of Mulan parents.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Mulan people are tall and slim, sometimes to the point of being gaunt. Their skin is sallow, and they usually remove what little body hair they have by means magical or mundane. They wear intricately designed tattoos in place of hair, usually on their bare skulls and where their eyebrows once were. These tattoos often represent dragons, demons, devils, and other creatures of ancient evil. They are extremely stylized, sometimes to the point of being cryptic runes or even abstract designs. Many Red Wizards use tattoo magic, and the fashion of tattooing arose from this. Even those without the power of the Red Wizards wish to look as though they do.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Almost all nobles in Thay are of Mulan descent, although not all Mulan are nobles. At worst, lowborn Mulan are free farmers or artisans, although many seek power that does not depend on their family&#39;s wealth, becoming bureaucrats, soldiers, or priests. For those with the aptitude, the path of the Red Wizard lies open. In fact, most Red Wizards come from Mulan families of relatively humble means (although high-born Red Wizards have the advantage of personal wealth and noble alliances to aid their advancement when they complete their training).</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.n7uvbkityud"><span class="c23 c10">Rashemi</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The common people in Thay are almost exclusively Rashemi, kin to the folk of Rashemen. The Rashemi are a hardy people, short and stocky with dusky skin and dark eyes. They all have thick, dark hair, although most free Rashemi choose to shave their scalps (or at the least, crop their hair quite short) to distinguish themselves from slaves, who are forbidden to cut their hair. Wealthy Rashemi often have themselves tattooed in the Mulan style.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thayan Rashemi are not a conquered people, nor are they oppressed. They do not have the same opportunities for advancement or wealth that people of Mulan descent do, but they think of themselves as Thayans first. The Rashemi are not happy about having the Mulan as their overlords, but they are resigned to their lot and take fierce pride in the strength and dark majesty of their land. Any Rashemi with sufficient means owns slaves, and most likely treats those slaves as harshly as they are treated anywhere in Thay. Few Red Wizards are of Rashemi descent, but Rashemi make up the bulk of Thay&#39;s free soldiers. Many of the most elite military forces are composed of cruel Rashemi warriors who are happy to serve the tharchions and Red Wizards.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.5m0yjvmj95mg"><span class="c6">Life and Society</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">There are four levels of Thayan society. They are, in order of increasing influence: slaves, commoners, nobles, and Red Wizards. It&#39;s no coincidence that this is also the decreasing order of population. There are far more slaves in Thay than any other group, but they have the least power. The Red Wizards, on the other hand, have few members but easily the most power.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.fhd3n5eclr0r"><span class="c23 c10">Slaves</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The lowest level of Thayan society is, of course, the slave. The economy of Thay is built upon slave labor, and without it the country would quickly collapse. The current trade in magic items has changed this only a little, and it has not improved the lives of slaves one whit.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Slaves are not considered citizens and have no rights. They are chattels, like livestock. Killing or harming a slave is not murder or mayhem. It is merely damaging someone&#39;s property. A slave&#39;s owner can do with his own slave as he wishes, but if he harms someone else&#39;s property, he is expected to make reparations.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Slaves are costly (a young human field slave sells for about 50 gp in the markets at Eltabbar), so few commoners have the means to own them. Since slaves represent a significant investment for a small farmer or artisan, common Thayans take good care of them. Slaves consigned to the broad estates of noble Thayans face a harder existence, and those unfortunate souls sold off to the vast state-run fields or mines are treated as nothing more than beasts of burden.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay imports slaves from all over Faer&ucirc;n, and just about every race is represented among the servile population. Those who survive the trip are usually the hardiest, but most do not last long in their job. House slaves live in relative comfort, caring directly for the needs of their Mulan masters. Those consigned to the mines rarely survive a year of scratching metals from the unforgiving Underdark.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.rcvfdlbg88y9"><span class="c23 c10">Commoners</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">As a whole, commoners do not have much better lives than slaves do. However, they are citizens, not property, which means they can&#39;t be indiscriminately tortured or killed. The Red Wizards can usually get away with such behavior, but they usually have to invent some sort of pretext for their actions.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Commoners have a far better life expectancy than slaves and better prospects overall. The worst jobs go to slaves, so by default, the commoners are a slight step up. Some have even managed to claw their way to the top of the heap, usually by becoming successful adventurers or wealthy merchants. A few are actually wealthier than most of the nobles and, even some Red Wizards. Most commoners are Rashemi, although there are a few members of this class from more distant lands.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.slmjv1dt507x"><span class="c23 c10">Nobles</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Most of Thay is owned by ancient noble families of Mulan descent. The dividing line between a well-off Mulan commoner and an impoverished Mulan lord is starkly defined by ancestry. Certain Mulan families are noble, and others aren&#39;t. The nobles of Thay are content to be governed by the Red Wizards (after all, the most influential mages in that order are nobles themselves), but they jealously maintain control over the elevation of commoners, even heroic ones, to noble status. Nobles enjoy two paths to comfort, power, and wealth: land and service. Wealthy nobles often own vast tracts of land and make money by leasing it to those who reside upon it, whether they are farmers, ranchers, or miners. Land ownership is not restricted to the noble classes, but in practice, most land in Thay is already owned by a noble, so it is difficult for a commoner to acquire land of his own.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Landless nobles (or those who simply wish to make something of themselves) often take up service in Thay&#39;s army, bureaucracy, or clergy. While any free Thayan can become a soldier, official, or priest, leaders are most often drawn from the ranks of well-off nobles who purchase their rank or title. For example, in a typical Thayan garrison, the captain is minor landed Mulan noble, his officers are landless Mulan nobles, and his sergeants are Rashemi veterans. The troops, of course, are mostly Rashemi. A noble who buys a good post can enrich himself just as easily as one who owns a great estate It is expected that a powerful official or highly-placed officer will divert a certain amount of &quot;taxes&quot; for his own use.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.3n2rqb4uh3p5"><span class="c23 c10">The Red Wizards</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">At an early age, noble children are carefully examined for any signs of arcane talent. Any who are shown to have even small aptitude are immediately inducted into wizardry school, followed by a long and arduous apprenticeship to a Red Wizard. Those who survive their apprenticeship and are ambitious, resourceful, and talented are invited to join the Red Wizards. Some refuse the red robes, but this is rare: Becoming a Red Wizard is such an obvious path to power that the zulkirs don&#39;t need to recruit anyone.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Red Wizards are the ruling class of this magocracy. It&#39;s illegal for any Red Wizard to take on an apprentice of other than Mulan blood. Some still do, however, and it&#39;s usually an open secret. At any given time, most Red Wizards claim up to a dozen apprentices (in game terms, wizards who have not yet acquired their first level in the Red Wizard prestige class), whom they keep at one another&#39;s throats to advance their own schemes. Apprentices exist to serve as the master&#39;s agents, minions, and thralls. What magical training they gain in the process is determined solely by their own ambition and initiative.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Only Red Wizards are permitted to wear red robes, their badge of office. The penalty for posing as one is instant death at the hands of the first Red Wizard to uncover the deception.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Red Wizards are ruled by a council of eight zulkirs, one representing each of the eight schools of magic. These positions are for life - the only way a zulkir would ever deign to leave office would be feet first. Within each school exists an elaborate pecking order, in which standing is determined by magical ability and the patronage of more powerful wizards. The current leader of the council is Szass Tam, the zulkir of necromancy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Red Wizards are evil through and through. Their ultimate goal is nothing less than world domination, and they have spent much of Thay&#39;s history in pursuit of that effort by military means. It&#39;s only within the past few years that they have set aside the ways of war in favor of more insidious, economic methods.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.mbsde4u7wjjs"><span class="c10 c23">Economy</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay&#39;s economy has traditionally been borne on the backs of the vast number of slaves who are brought into the country in chains. With the increase of trade in magic items over the past few years, the number of slaves sold in Thay hasn&#39;t gone down one bit. In fact, now that Thay has enclaves in just about every major city of Faer&ucirc;n, its merchants have even more access to slaves, and the slave population is actually growing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Revenue from the sale of discounted magic items in the enclaves has far exceeded expectations. Thayan merchants have long traded, their nation&#39;s goods throughout the world, but they are finding their wares in high demand these days. Before the change in policy, the vast bulk of Thayan exports were raw foodstuffs, timber - including that of the highly prized blackwood tree - and Thayan artwork, jewelry, and crafts, mostly fashioned by skilled slaves. Such trade continues to this day, cementing Thay as a mercantile powerhouse.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Everyone the Thayans do business with is aware of their horrible history and their evil ways. The prices and quality of their wares, however, are just too good to turn down. This suits Szass Tam and the rest of the zulkirs, who have not given up their goal of world domination. The current plan is to use the greed of other people as a tool against them. Bearing discounted goods, Thayans should be able to work their way into every major economy on Faer&ucirc;n. Once the Red Wizards have become entrenched in a nation, they can learn enough about the locals to dismantle them quietly from within.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Not all the zulkirs agree with this policy. This is particularly true of the more aggressive leaders such as Aznar Thrul, as well as those who aren&#39;t in a position to line their own pockets with the wealth brought in by this new venture, such as Zulkir Nevron of the school of conjuration. As with most large projects in Thay, this one could be brought low at any point by the bickering of the zulkirs.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.q7pqj5hgt67v"><span class="c23 c10">Law and Order</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Anyone, foreigner or Thayan, traveling in Thay must carry a pass issued by a tharchion allowing the traveler to use specific roads and visit specific cities. All tharchions delegate the task of issuing passes to minor officials and officers, which means that a travel permit for most points can be purchased with a suitable bribe (generally, 10 to 50 gp for foreigners). Soldiers, messengers, and officials engaged in the performance of their duties are exempt from the requirement to obtain permission to travel, but they generally carry tokens of their authority.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Outsiders traveling without authorization find it difficult, if not impossible, to move about the plateau. Patrols constantly scour the roads and byways, searching for escaped slaves (and the occasional brigand, criminal, or foreign spy). The penalty for being caught is usually death. Those found inside a Red Wizard&#39;s estate, on the other hand, are in for an even worse fate as the subject of painful magical experiments.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The laws of Thay are, simple, and the penalties are brutal. They are mostly concerned with establishing who&#39;s in power. The tharchions and zulkirs consult a set of tomes known as the Library of Law when faced with a serious problem. However, most of the time, the authorities ignore these books in favor of expediency. These are the most important laws of Thay.</span></p><ul class="c36 lst-kix_7636jcgvzox2-0 start"><li class="c4 c40 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Only Red Wizards may wear red robes, so that all shall be able to identify them instantly.</span></li><li class="c4 c40 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Do not steal from other Thayans or harm their belongings, especially their slaves.</span></li><li class="c4 c40 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Do not kill or harm another Thayan. (In practice, this means, &quot;Do not kill or harm anyone from your class or above.&quot;)</span></li><li class="c4 c40 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Obey the orders of your betters.</span></li></ul><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The proscription against wearing red robes is unusual, but Thayans take it so seriously that most refuse to dress in any clothing of that color. The penalty for being caught in such garb is execution on the spot. It&#39;s rumored that some of the forces of the Red Wizards always carry a spare red robe or two. This is then supposedly thrown onto the body after the guards have killed someone, giving them an excuse for their actions.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The laws of Thay are enforced by whoever claims to have jurisdiction over the people involved or the location in which the disturbance occurred. In Thay, just about every Red Wizard employs slaves or commoners as private guards. The more powerful the person, the more numerous and more skilled the guards. In Thay, might makes right, and the Red Wizards have plenty of might. The trouble comes when more than one group of guards claims jurisdiction over any particular issue. This happens often, and when it does, a fight usually breaks out.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.6ivpvb822tc5"><span class="c23 c10">Defense and Warcraft</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay is a military powerhouse, its combined armies outnumbering those of all its neighbors put together. However, due to a lack of cooperation between the various forces, Thay has never been as effective as it should be.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Each zulkir and tharchion is expected to form a body of troops known as a legion. Only a sponsor&#39;s resources limit the legion&#39;s makeup and size. Other Red Wizards are permitted household forces or bodyguards, too. The wealthiest of them may have thousands of troops at their disposal. Sadly - or fortunately, depending on one&#39;s point of view - the disparate Thayan forces work together as poorly as do their leaders. Only during extreme threats to the entire nation are the various armies able to put aside their differences and work with one another. Even then, their cooperation is hardly complete.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The various legions include a motley conglomeration of races and even monsters in their numbers. Goblin slaves, orc and half-orc mercenaries, and human cavalry are the most popular troops. Gnolls are common, but due to their cowardly natures, they are most often deployed as skirmishers and raiders rather than as front-line troops. Companies of hill giants, ogres, and trolls make terrifying foes on the field of battle. Cavalry units use many different kinds of mounts, including creatures not ridden anywhere else in Faer&ucirc;n. Centaurs, manticores, leucrotas, griffons, hippogriffs, giant beetles, and even dragons serve Thay&#39;s elite troops, although horses are much more common. The most notorious units feature female riders mounted on the feared black unicorns bred by the Red Wizards. The best-known army of Thay is the Griffon Legion, a group of some four hundred Red Wizards commanded by the tharchion of Pyarados - currently Tharchion Nymia Focar - soaring through the skies on the backs of griffons. The most successful soldier breeding program in recent years has been the blooded ones, or blood orcs. Fierce, loyal, and physically powerful, the blooded ones make excellent shock troops. It&#39;s now rare to find a legion that doesn&#39;t have at least one unit of blood orcs in it. The Red Wizards are experimenting on other races with the techniques used to create blooded ones, too, so it may be only a matter of time before even more &quot;blood&quot; races are seen in the armies of Thay.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Few of Thay&#39;s cities have walls or other defenses. The Thayans regard the First Escarpment as a wall around the entire country and plan to halt invaders at the edge of the precipice. Thayan cities that lie below the escarpment (Bezantur, for example) are often protected by extensive walls. The first line of defense for Thay is the constant and vigorous patrolling of both its borders and its interior. This provides the zulkirs with an early warning system that allows them plenty of time to respond to any massive attack.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.xo2eur8qkyn1"><span class="c23 c10">Religion</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Arcane magic is supreme in Thay, but even the most jaded of the Red Wizards can&#39;t deny the power of the gods. Even the zulkirs at least pay lip service to a chosen deity. To do otherwise is to invite retribution. Evil deities - Beshaba, Loviatar, Shar, Talona, Umberlee, and Gargauth the Outcast - are openly worshiped. Veneration of good gods is not forbidden, but it is discouraged. Still, the Red Wizards know that there are times when anyone - even a lawful good deity - can come in handy, so they rarely advocate the burning of any metaphorical bridges.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The most widespread and powerful faith in Thay is that of Kossuth, the Lord of Flames. The Thayans find the neutral-aligned elemental deities to be a good match for their oppressive land. The tenets of good deities such as Tyr or Lathander stand in direct opposition to the hierarchy built by the Red Wizards, and evil deities demand the submission of their followers. Kossuth represents power and mastery without constraints, and so he finds favor among the Red Wizards. Kossuth&#39;s faith enjoys a primacy of position and numerous special considerations in Thayan society. Clerics of the Firelord are among the very few people a Red Wizard cannot harm or kill with impunity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The worship of Bane has had a long tradition in Thay. While the church of the Black Lord suffered after the Time of Troubles - during which Cyric arose to take Bane&#39;s place - the return of Bane has resulted in strong and well-organized churches of both Bane and Cyric in Thay. A number of Thayans venerate Mask, and this number has been steadily but quietly growing in the past few years.; Shar&#39;s faith is also strongly ensconced in Thay.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The brutal humanoids in the service of the Red Wizards continue to worship their own pantheons. Orcs venerate Gruumsh, much as they do elsewhere, and gnolls worship the demon-god Yeenoghu.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">A common misconception outside Thay is that the Red Wizards worship demons and devils. Actually, many ambitious Red Wizards do make regular contact with such evil outsiders, but only to strike bargains with the creatures. The Red Wizards consider themselves the equals of such beings - at least when they band together as a group, just as they did when they summoned the demon Eltab to help them in their quest for independence from Mulhorand.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.xs8gvf2ezqg2"><span class="c6">Adventurers</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Outlanders are observed suspiciously throughout Thay. The zulkirs have done enough spying of their own over the centuries to know they are likely being spied on too. This is especially true because of the anti-scrying magic that covers most of the country. The only way for most foreign governments to learn what is happening in Thay is by sending in spies to handle the investigation personally.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thus, it&#39;s hard for a party of adventurers to get into Thay without being watched. Those suspected of espionage are summarily executed, and most Red Wizards aren&#39;t above accusing troublesome innocents of espionage just to have an excuse to kill them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">However, the zulkirs have realized that there are times during which a group of adventurers might come in handy. There are many ruins scattered about Thay, for instance, especially in Delhumide and in the Sunrise Mountains. The zulkirs and tharchions permit adventurers to poke around in such places, as long as they get a cut of any profits. They manage this in several ways, from overcharging for supplies to selling permits to actually demanding a share of treasure. Adventurers can stay at many inns across Thay. However, the locals are wary of people who are ignorant of the ways of the nation. There are just too many ways to run afoul of the Red Wizards and their cronies for most people to feel comfortable around visitors. On the other hand, many commoners and even some nobles see such newcomers as the perfect pawns in their schemes, unschooled as they are in the art of Thayan politics.</span></p><h1 class="c14" id="h.139cr9ijo1k3"><span class="c20">History of Thay</span></h1><h3 class="c8" id="h.elsxbz26fqlc"><span class="c6">Politics and Power</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">In Thay, politics and power are inextricably related. Those in charge are those who have the power to take charge. Most of</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">the Red Wizards (essentially the ruling class) are of noble birth and would command obedience and fealty in any land by virtue of their bloodlines alone, but those at the very top - the zulkirs - have to claw their way there.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The growing wealth of the Guild of Foreign Trade may be changing this time-honored tradition. The Guild&#39;s officers have been catapulted to astounding wealth by the success of the mercantile enclaves. The wisest among them realize that such power can be ephemeral, especially if the more warlike tharchs and zulkirs get their way, so they are doing everything they can to secure their long-term positions. Chief among these is Master of the Guild Samas Kul (LE male human Tra7/Red5), the organization&#39;s top officer. He has made himself one of the most influential and powerful Red Wizards, second only to the zulkirs.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.vuprkn8qsxn4"><span class="c6">History of Thay</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Ever since its founding, Thay has been ruled by ambitious wizards who believe their ultimate destiny is to rule the world. Although they have extended their rule into the Wizards&#39; Reach and the Lapendrar vale, they&#39;ve had less success in subjugating the neighboring realms of Aglarond and Rashemen. However, with the opening of Thayan enclaves in cities across Faer&ucirc;n, the Red Wizards can finally claim to have extended their territory across most of the continent. Before an enclave is built, the Red Wizards insist that the local government cede the land to Thay and Thay&#39;s laws apply within the walls of these disparate and far-flung places.</span></p><table class="c31"><tr class="c24"><td class="c19 c37" colspan="3" rowspan="1"><h2 class="c17" id="h.wntwth4ze2cw"><span class="c23 c32">Timeline</span></h2><h2 class="c17" id="h.wntwth4ze2cw-2"><span class="c23 c32">&nbsp;</span></h2></td></tr><tr class="c25"><td class="c43" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c10">Year</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c10">Event</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c16"><td class="c7" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c0">-1087</span></p></td><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c0">wizard Thayd leads a rebellion of mages against Mulhorand and Unther, seizing the northern provinces of both empires as his own territory.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c25"><td class="c7" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c0">-1081</span></p></td><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Thayd and his conspirators are defeated.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c16"><td class="c7" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c0">-1076</span></p></td><td class="c18" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c0">Orcgate opens in the southern portion of the Plateau of Thay.

Of them all, Szass Tam has the most influence over his fellows. He is the most powerful of them, and in his long years as a lich he has entrenched himself so deeply that he could never be forced from office by anything short of a very permanent death.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The zulkirs appoint tharchions, or governors, to run the eleven tharchs. These tharchions in turn appoint a number of local bureaucrats called autharchs to oversee various locations and projects for them. Autharchs are often replaced quickly, always at the whim of their tharchion. Those who are incompetent are removed soon after being discovered. Those who are successful are promoted to tharchion as soon as there&#39;s an opening, but many of the current tharchions, not wishing to lose their jobs, engineer the downfall of such hopefuls to eliminate contenders. Only the truly ruthless and resourceful manage to work their way up to the rank of tharchion, and they&#39;re not going to go down without a fight.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The leader of a trade enclave is called a khazark. This position is supposedly equal in rank to an autharch, but in practice, it is even more respected, because only Red Wizards can hold such rank. Members of any class can become tharchions, the highest post in the land to which a Thayan can aspire who is not one of the Red Wizards.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">There is supposed to be a chain of command in which the zulkirs hand orders down to the tharchions and khazarks, and they to their inferiors, and so on until commoners boss around slaves. In reality, the zulkirs order around whomever they like, whenever they like. None dare tell them they should work differently. The problem is that the zulkirs end up being the only ones who can see the big picture. Since there are eight of them, each with their personal agenda, each issues orders that are often in direct conflict with others. It is then up to subordinate Thayans to choose which master to follow and hope they can escape the wrath of the zulkir whose orders they were forced to ignore.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This inherent problem with the Thayan government has proved to be its weak point again .and again. Because there is no one in charge of everything, no one responsible for making it all work, the various factions in Thay end up spending more time battling one another than carrying out their plans for world domination. This has been a saving grace for the rest of Toril. Should a single zulkir ever manage to take full control of the nation, the rest of the world is in for a rough ride.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The latest example of Thayan disharmony is the fact that not every zulkir and tharchion is behind the &quot;make trade, not war&quot; doctrine the zulkirs are currently following. Tharchion Homen Odesseiron of Surthay, for instance, is planning to launch an invasion of Rashemen soon, largely at the urging of Tharchion Azhir Kren of Gauros, who is itching for a fight. Both tharchions feel they have been shut out of the prosperity brought about by the trade boom, and they are desperate to reestablish themselves as the figures of importance they were during Thay&#39;s more warlike years.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Both Odesseiron and Kren have been massing their forces for months. They plan to take Mulsantir before anyone, zulkirs and the Rashemi alike, realizes what is happening. They believe that if they succeed, there will be no complaints from Eltabbar. If they fail, they hope to be dead enough to be beyond even the necromantic grasp of Szass Tam.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.dq6133qjxw9l"><span class="c6">Enemies</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">From Thay&#39;s point of view, every other nation in the world is its foe. It used to be that the Thayans expressed this belief openly, making diplomatic efforts pointless. In recent years, as a part of their trade plans, they have toned down their rhetoric. The Red Wizards see themselves and their way of life as superior to all else, but they are circumspect enough not to tattoo this on their own foreheads or on those of their defeated foes - for now.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.bh4k4b931zy0"><span class="c23 c10">Aglarond</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Over the centuries, the Aglarondans have been Thay&#39;s most implacable foe. From the Thayan point of view, the peninsula of Aglarond must be theirs. It&#39;s a perfect point from which to launch offensives into the other lands surrounding the Sea of Fallen Stars. If the land is not in Thayan hands, it&#39;s the primary spot from which any counteroffensive against Thay would likely begin.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Despite their best efforts, the soldiers of Thay have never been able to penetrate Aglarond. The Dragonjaw Mountains and the Yuirwood defend the country almost as thoroughly as the First Escarpment guards Thay, and the Aglarondans have made the most of these advantages. The primary example of this is the Watchwall, which keeps the Red Wizards from sending undead troops through the treacherous Umber Marshes into Aglarond.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Red Wizards have an especially cold hatred in their rotten hearts for the Simbul. It frustrates them to no end that a woman - and a sorcerer to boot - can thwart their combined efforts. The zulkirs are elated that the Simbul agreed to the most recent truce, but they are suspicious at the same time. They hope she will soon permit them to place an enclave in Glarondar, but they know it will require far more to worm their way into Aglarond than simply asking.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.wkqblqkh2ek"><span class="c23 c10">Mulhorand</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">To the Thayans, Mulhorand is the gateway to southern Faer&ucirc;n. Also, it is the motherland of the Mulan people, whom the Red Wizards would love to unite under a single banner. However, Mulhorand, once a nation in decline, is on the rise once again.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay has tried to invade Mulhorand a number of times over the centuries since winning its independence. The largest problem has always been the geography of the region. Only a narrow strip of land along the Sunrise Mountains allows Thay to march an army south. The Mulhorandi always patrol this territory, so the Thayans have a hard time getting far into the country. Likewise, the Mulhorandi Empire has attacked Thay on more than one occasion, hoping to recapture their long-lost northern province and forge an unstoppable giant in eastern Faer&ucirc;n.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Foiled by the stalemate in the north, Mulhorand recently turned west and invaded decrepit Unther. Like everyone else, the Red Wizards have little love for Gilgeam the Tyrant, but they also have no desire to see Mulhorand accomplish anything easily. They hope to mire the Mulhorandi army in years of anarchy and chaos in the wreckage of Unther and are funneling gold, magic, and mercenaries south to prop up the remnant of Gilgeam&#39;s domain.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.1x7ops1p3j8q"><span class="c23 c10">Rashemen</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Rashemen has been the subject of more Thayan invasion attempts than any other country. The land itself seems to work against the Red Wizards. The reason for so many invasions of Rashemen - and so many failures - is that the tharchions of Surthay and Gauros usually hurl their forces across Lake Mulsantir with little to no preparation. They often have some sort of &quot;guaranteed&quot; scheme that never works out. Some of the darkest jokes told around Rashemi inns concern foolish Red Wizards and their latest plans.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">If Tharchions Azhir Kren and Homen Odesseiron have their way, though, the Rashemi will soon trade their laughter for tears. The two leaders have been secretly massing forces along the southern shore of Lake Mulsantir with an eye toward a lightning strike on the city of Mulsantir itself.</span></p><h1 class="c14" id="h.gkroupmqifbo"><span class="c20">Cities and Sites of Thay</span></h1><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay is a large and long-settled country. Its great plateau is covered with towns, settlements, and villages, as well as a number of major cities. The cities of Thay are crowded and dirty, mostly because great portions of the population - the slaves and their humanoid guards - live in filth and squalor. The poor and enslaved live in little better than hovels made of adobe.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The wealthy and the powerful inhabit a completely different world. Their sprawling villas are surrounded by walled gardens designed not only to provide privacy but also to keep out the noises and smells of the city. These brick or stone buildings are often several stories high, emphasizing the fact that the powerful in Thay are above the rabble physically as well as metaphorically.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.2p9fo3i6i8yp"><span class="c6">Amruthar (Metropolis)</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The city of Amruthar is independent of Thay, despite the fact that it sits in the middle of the tharch of Lapendrar. Four hundred-years ago, when the Red Wizards launched their overthrow of Mulhorandi rule, a powerful satrap named Sekhotet governed the southwestern sector of the province, ruling from this city. Sekhotet desired to govern his lands without answering to a pharaoh in Skuld, so he threw in with the wizards, aiding and abetting their rebellion. The price Sekhotet asked was a free hand to rule Amruthar as he liked. Sekhotet&#39;s line has long since died out, but the zulkirs have honored the letter of their agreement with the Mulhorandi lord&#39;s successors.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Amruthar may still be independent, but it&#39;s commonly known that its current ruler, Hierarch Numos Thal (LE male human Ari9), is merely a puppet of the zulkirs. He and the rest of the aristocracy of the city are well paid for their complacency, and in turn, they surrender a portion of all financial transactions made in the city to Thay. The arrangement has worked well for centuries, and neither the hierarch nor the zulkirs see any reason to change it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This is not true for many of Amruthar&#39;s citizens, though. Three factions vie for the chance to lead the people in a revolution against their corrupt and decadent leaders. The largest group is known as the Realists. They wish to depose the hierarch while maintaining the city&#39;s relationship with Thay. They know that their city could never stand against the forces of the Red Wizards, so their leaders curry favor with the zulkirs. In truth, if the zulkirs have a falling out with the hierarch, they&#39;d be happy to let the Realists take over, but that day isn&#39;t here yet.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The members of the second-largest faction are known as Independents. They want to sever all ties with Thay and transform Amruthar into a true city-state. The Independents realize that Thay would have a problem with this, but they hope the old agreement of Sekhotet and Thay&#39;s current prosperity might dissuade the zulkirs from seizing the city by force of arms. In the meantime, they advocate the quiet growth of Amruthar&#39;s military and economic might, hoping to strengthen the city for the eventual break.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The smallest faction call themselves the Westerners. They wish to join Aglarond, bringing their city under the protection of another land. The zulkirs would never allow this, of course, and while the Simbul is sympathetic to Amruthar&#39;s plight, she is not prepared to commit herself to fight a war on Amruthar&#39;s behalf. Aglarond has traditionally excelled at defending its borders, but even the most rabid Thay-haters in Velprintalar do not think it possible to fight the Red Wizards on the Plateau of Thay and win. Hierarch Thal is anxious to stamp out any public debate along these lines, fearing that the Westerners in their folly might provide the zulkirs with the excuse to end Amruthar&#39;s special independence.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Amruthar (Metropolis): Conventional/magical/nonstandard/nonstandard; AL LE/NE/N/CN; 100,000 gp limit; Assets 205,200,000 gp; Population 41,040; Mixed (human 80%, half-elf-8%, halfling 6%, half-orc 4%, gnome 1%, elf 1%).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Authority Figures: Hierarch Numos Thal, LE male human Ari9 (hereditary ruler of the city, and a puppet of the Red Wizards); Hezass Nymar, NE male human ClrS of Kossuth (the tharch of Lapendrar; he lives in Eltabbar, but maintains offices in Amruthar); Timbra Wenz, N female human Ari14 (leader of the Realists); Purtek Friina, CN male human Rog6/Ftr4 (leader of the Independents).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Important Characters: Yesvel Rethume, LN female human Sor16 (the city&#39;s foremost arcane spellcaster); Tharek the Black Shield, LE male half-fiend Clr13 of Bane (leader of the city&#39;s House of the Black Lord); Orimel Drudaryn, CG female half-elf rogue 5/fighter 5/Aglarondan griffonrider 4 (an Aglarondan spy who keeps an eye on developments in Amruthar at the Simbul&#39;s orders).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12 c19">City Guard</span><span class="c19 c13">: Ftr7, Ftr6, War6, Ftr5 (2), War5 (5), Ftr4 (3), War4 (7), Ftr3 (9), War3 (21), Ftr2 (23), War2 (76), Ftr1 (44), War1 (307); </span><span class="c12 c19">Hierarch&#39;s Guard</span><span class="c0 c19">: Ftr9, Clr8, Ftr7, War6, Clr5, Ftr5 (3), War5 (4), Clr4 (2), Ftr4 (5), War4 (30), Clr3 (4), Ftr3 (18), War3 (129).

The city is the capital of the tharch of Priador and is the largest port in the Red Wizards&#39; domain. For centuries, Thayan cotton, fruit, and grain flowed through Bezantur, enriching the masters of the city and the tharchion, but the wealth pouting in now is unimaginable. To Bezantur flow the gold, goods, and slaves exchanged in dozens of Thayan enclaves across the Sea of Fallen Stars, so it is not only the largest city in Thay but by far the wealthiest.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Black-walled Bezantur squats on the northern shore of the Alamber Sea. Artisans, merchants, priests, and soldiers live crammed within its walls, while beyond sprawls an immense and squalid shantytown of commoners and slave pens. No tree grows within twenty miles of the city; great shipyards even larger than those of the Alaor lie along the shore beyond its walls, employing hundreds of carpenters and shipwrights and thousands of slaves. On the eastern side of the city, within newly built walls even higher and stronger than the city&#39;s own, stands the Guild of Foreign Trade, the heart of Thay&#39;s sinister enterprise to enslave the West through commerce.</span></p><p class="c4"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 365.33px;"><img alt="map" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 365.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.rpiogcbqpjz2"><span class="c23 c10">The Central Citadel</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This heavily fortified structure is one of Bezantur&#39;s most notable landmarks, dominating the city center. Made of hewn black stone stacked tall enough to be seen from any place in the city, the Central Citadel is the first building visible to people approaching Bezantur, even before the low shanties mounded up against the outside of the wall like rats nesting.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The citadel houses the legion of Aznar Thrul (zulkir of evocation and tharchion of the Priador) as well as his own luxurious private quarters. These armed forces include nearly 5,000 gnolls, humans, goblins, darkenbeasts, and creatures even more foul.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The previous tharchion - who most believe to be long dead - secretly lives here as well. Mari Agneh has been bent entirely to Thrul&#39;s will, and he keeps her as a private slave, occasionally trotting her out at his most debauched private parties to demonstrate his power. Thrul is fond of magical experimentation, and he keeps a number of well-stocked laboratories here, as well as dungeons filled with fresh victims for his trials.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.6zektx934ng7"><span class="c23 c10">The Guild Of Foreign Trade</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay&#39;s foreign enclaves are administered through the Guild of Foreign Trade, headquartered in a vast complex of warehouses, vaults, and fortress-like offices dominating the eastern end of Bezantur&#39;s harbor. The Guild has existed for hundreds of years, issuing licenses to Thayans wishing to import or export goods, but in the last twenty years, its sponsorship of mercantile enclaves dealing in magic items has catapulted the Guild from a small, corrupt bureaucracy to a vast, corrupt, state-sponsored industry. The guild is naturally obsessed with the safety of its valuable merchandise, and its vaults are guarded by hundreds of wizards, skilled warriors, and monstrous creatures. Thousands of laborers and slaves toil at its docks and warehouses, loading and unloading the yellow-sailed dromonds that carry the output of magic workshops to Thayan concessions and quarters across the Inner Sea. The dromonds return even more heavily laden than they were when they set out, since most of the goods exchanged for Thayan magic items are bulkier and heavier than a cargo of potions, scrolls, and wondrous items.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Master of the Guild of Foreign Trade is a brilliant Red Wizard named Samas Kul (LE male human Tra7/Red8). Ambitious and cynical, Samas Kul is known for his acidic sarcasm and urbane manner. He is a tall, corpulent man who flaunts his wealth shamelessly, bedecking himself with gem-studded robes and rings worth thousands of gold pieces. Some of Samas Kul&#39;s colleagues have mistakenly dismissed him as a money-grubbing merchant in red robes, but the Master of the Guild is a wizard of no small skill and stands high in the ranks of the school of transmutation.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.h2kc3tn7z5fs"><span class="c23 c10">Notable Businesses</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Hundreds of artisans, merchants, and laborers fill Bezantun&#39;s commercial districts. The most important pant of the city&#39;s economy, however, are the docks that run the length of the city&#39;s shore. Hundreds of ships from every land on the Sea of Fallen Stars are moored to these stone quays or rock gently at anchor in the bay beyond, waiting for their turn to tie up and take on cargo.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The docks range widely in quality and safety. Some rival the finest in the world; others amount to a rocky patch of shore where one might shove a rowboat. No matter where a ship&#39;s master moors, however, she can expect to be charged for the privilege. In the better parts of town, the docking fee earns her top-level service and protection from the ever-emboldened members of the local thieves&#39; guild. In the worst parts, she is essentially paying the local thugs not to rob her. If they keep anyone else from robbing her too, so much the better.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">A traveler can find just about any kind of legitimate merchandise imaginable within the city&#39;s walls. For those in search of something less legitimate, Tharchion Thrul has long turned a blind eye toward any dealings in Market Town, a cluster of shacks that cozy up against the city&#39;s mighty walls like remoras near a shark&#39;s gills.</span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.qejxvaq4zywg"><span class="c23 c10">Major Temples</span></h4><p class="c4"><span class="c0">One of Bezantur&#39;s many nicknames is &quot;the City of in Thousand Temples.&quot; Just about every god in every pantheon on the face of Faer&ucirc;n is represented here. This is one of the few major cities in which evil deities are worshiped proudly and openly, and some of their most magnificent temples are in Bezantun. Only the patronage of Mystra and Azuth is forbidden; the Red Wizards jealously guard access to arcane knowledge by any means outside of their own tutelage. The most popular gods among Bezantur&#39;s people are Umberlee and Mask.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Temple of Umberlee is monstrously large, carved from massive blocks of blue-veined green marble, reminiscent of the watery domain of the goddess of the deep. Traditionally, Umberlee is honored with wealth thrown from a ship&#39;s railing into the waters of the open sea. The people of Bezantur have refined this a bit. Instead, they rob the captains of ships, throw some of their ill-gotten gains in the water, pocket some of it for themselves, and bring the remainder to this temple. Those who brave the shark-, sahuagin-, and monster-infested waters of Bezantur&#39;s harbor to gather loot offered up to the Bitch Queen invariably suffer death by drowning, no matter how far from the sea they flee.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Temple of Mask doubles as the headquarters of the extremely powerful thieves&#39; guild. Its leader, Guildmistress Shabella the Pale (NE female human Rog7/Clr11 of Mask), struggles to maintain her position against an incursion by the Shadowmastens of Telflamm. The guild here controls nearly all of the illegal activities in and around Bezantur, making it too juicy a target for the Shadowmasters to pass up. The thieves in the city are choosing sides, and an alarming number have thrown in their lot with the Theskians, weary of Shabella&#39;s tyranny.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Bezantur (Metropolis): Magical/magical/nonstandard/nonstandard; AL LE/LE/CE/NE; 100,000 gp limit; Assets 684,000,000 gp; Population 136,800; Mixed (human 81%, gnoll 8%, orc 6%, half-orc 3%, halfling 1%, other 1%).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Authority Figures: Aznar Thrul (LE male human Evo10/Red10/Acm1/Epic2 (zulkir of evocation and tharchion of the Priador); Samas Kul, LE male human Tra7/Red8 (Master of the Guild of Foreign Trade); Alyssa, CE female human Clr12 of Umberlee (high priestess of the Temple of Umberlee); Shabella the Pale, NE female human Rog7/Clr11 of Mask (Guildmistress of the Temple of Mask).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Important Characters: Autharch Ithrash, LE male human Ftr9/Rog4/Blk4 (commander of Aznar Thrul&#39;s legion and the city guard); Thavar Shom, CE male human shadow-walker rogue 9/fighter 2/Telflammar shadowlord 4 (leader of the Shadowmasters moving into the city).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Aznar Thrul&#39;s Legion: Ftr16, Ftr15, Ftr14 (2), War14 (3), Ftr13 (2), War13 (4), Ftr12 (3), War12 (4), Ftr11 (3), War11 (6), Ftr10 (4), War10 (8), Ftr9 (6), War9 (9), Ftr8 (6), War8 (11), Ftr7 (6), War7 (16), Ftr6 (9), War6 (19), Ftr5 (21), War5 (11), Ftr4 (35), War4 (141), Ftr3 (44), War3 (420), Ftr2 (77), War2 (1,001), Ftr1 (173), War1 (786), gnolls without class levels (1,950); Militia: War5 (43), War4 (122), War3 (386), War2 (955), War1 (2,940).

The identity of the place&#39;s original owners has been lost in the swirls of time, but murals and carvings found in its lowest halls depict an advanced lizardfolk civilization destroyed so long ago as to be forgotten. It&#39;s possible that the lizardfolk of the Surmarsh are descendants of this ancient people, but if so, their fall from grace was particularly hard. The primitive lizardfolk wouldn&#39;t have the first idea how to go about creating such an amazing place.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The Citadel - not to be confused with the dozens of lesser citadels scattered about the country - has long been off-limits to the Thayan people. Foreigners are not even supposed to be told of its existence. In earlier years, the Red Wizards sent expeditions into the place to explore as much of it as they could. Some returned with treasure, including gold, artwork, and even powerful magic items. However, more often than not, the parties of explorers never returned at all. Those brave (or simply lucky) souls who did return spoke of a vast network of tunnels beneath the mountain, infested with the more notorious subterranean races, including troglodytes and drow.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">One of the more successful ventures retrieved a tome that describes the lower levels of the Citadel in detail: A portion of the place, known as the Paths of the Doomed, is a maze of tunnels occupied by all sorts of monsters. How they got there and why they stay remains a mystery to this day. Zulkir Szass Tam has confiscated the book for his own studies, and few outside of his direct circle of peers - the other zulkirs - have ever actually seen it, much less read from it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Today, only a select few of the most prominent Red Wizards are permitted anywhere near the known entrances to the Citadel. Whether the zulkirs are trying to keep intruders out or keep something even more dangerous in, only they can say.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.lj4vl0kyhw8a"><span class="c6">Ruins of Delhumide</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Delhumide (the city, not the tharch named after it) was the provincial capital back when Thay was just another part of the Mulhorandi Empire. When the Thayans rebelled against Mulhorand in 922 DR. they summoned a number of demons to help them in their quest for freedom. These creatures razed the once-proud city to the ground, removing the largest symbol of Mulhorandi might forever from the face of Thay.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Today, no structure in the ruins of Delhumide stands taller than one story high. However, the labyrinthine tunnel system that ran beneath the old city remains intact. Rumor has it that the subterranean depths are filled with dangerous creatures, including demons that evaded the Red Wizards&#39; attempts to dismiss them back to the Abyss after the evil creatures had outlived their usefulness.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Tharchion Metron has little interest in exploring the ruins, despite the rumors of great treasure that have surrounded them since their creation. His predecessor lost his life in just such an expedition, despite Metron&#39;s warning not to go. So far, the unusual Thayan peace has been good to the tharch of Delhumide, and Metron has no desire to tamper with what has been working for him. If times get tough, though, he may become desperate enough to poke around in the rubble for something that can solidify his position. In the meantime, the ruins of Delhumide are a common destination for adventurers of all stripes. Metron has come up with a clever scheme to put this to his advantage. The patrols within Metron&#39;s tharch are under orders to keep track of out-landers heading into Delhumide - or any of the other nearby ruins, for that matter. Once the intruders enter, the patrols call for help, then surround the ruins and wait for the adventurers to emerge. In this way, Metron gets adventurers to do the dangerous work of rummaging around in the underground chambers, while he reaps the ill-gotten fruits of their labors.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Some captured groups of adventurers are sent into the ruins time and time again. They are permitted to live as long as they continue to bring back treasure and magic items. Those who fail to do so are executed on the spot. Still, many desperate souls find this preferable to reentering the tortured ruins.</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.2r3rrfodyjng"><span class="c6">Eltabbar (Metropolis)</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The second-largest city in Thay, Eltabbar is the country&#39;s capital. Getting around can be difficult for an stranger without a guide, for maps of the city are forbidden to anyone who is not a Red Wizard. This odd law is a holdover from the days when Eltabbar&#39;s streets formed a massive diagram imprisoning the demon lord Eltab. The River Eltar flows through the city in an elaborate series of canals before meeting Lake Thaylambar, which the city overlooks. These canals were also part of the magical prison that held Eltab beneath the city, but the Abyssal creature escaped after an earthquake rocked the region a few years back. There are rumors that a demon resides in this prison once again, but no one knows whether the prisoner is Eltab or some other evil monster.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The ruler of Eltabbar is Tharchion Dmitra Flass (LE female human Ill17/Red8). Of all the tharchions and zulkirs, she is by far the most diplomatic. Without her considerable skills, the zulkirs might have fallen into open civil war long ago. (Szass Tam&#39;s intimidating style of rulership might work well with most Thayans, but his fellow zulkirs aren&#39;t so easily impressed.) Eltabbar is also the capital of its home tharch, a long stretch of land that wraps around the northern side of Thaymount. Flass is often too busy with intrigues at home to worry about the rest of the tharch, but she makes up for it with relatively enlightened methods of governing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Eltabbar is the center of the nation&#39;s slave trade, as well as its political center. Thousands of slaves are brought into the markets here every year and auctioned off in the bloodstained public blocks. Once dispatched to their new assignments, most can look forward to at best a few months of backbreaking labor followed by a quick death.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Eltabbar (Metropolis): Magical/conventional/conventional/nonstandard; AL NE/LE/LE/LN; 100,000 gp limit; Assets 615,600,000 gp; Population 123,120; Mixed (human 83%, gnoll 8%, orc 7% half-orc 1%, other 1%).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Authority Figures: Szass Tam, NE male lich Nec10/Red10/Acm2/Epic7 (zulkir of necromancy and the most powerful of the zulkirs); Dmitra Flass, LE female human Ill17/Red5 (tharchion of Eltabbar); Dipren Qarto, LE male human Ftr16 (leader of the city guard); High Flamelord Iphegor Nath, LN male human Clr13/Dis4 of Kossuth (leader of Kossuth&#39;s faith in Thay).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Important Characters: Kwinset Tanzirk, LE female human Wiz6/Red6 (administrator of the slave market); Bilhar Sentolan, NE male human Rog13/Asn4 (master of the thieves&#39; guild).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">City Guard: Ftr14, War14, War13, Ftr12, War12 (2), Ftr11 (2), Ftr10 (2), War10 (3), Ftr9 (4), War9 (4), Ftr8 (5), War8 (8), Ftr7 (6), War7 (11), Ftr6 (8), War6 (14), Ftr5 (11), War5 (38), Ftr4 (20), War4 (102), Ftr3 (31), War3 (336), Ftr2 (54), War2 (814), Ftr1 (128), War1 (635), gnolls without class levels (1,633); Militia: War4 (96), War3 (329), War2 (716), War1 (2,044).

The most recent break came during the time of the Great Inner Sea Plague, but the Thayans returned to the region in 1357 DR. and they have ruled over Escalant continuously ever since.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Escalant was first settled around 400 DR. Today, the city sprawls beyond the cramped limitations of the crumbling wall long ago thrown up around the place. Over 28,000 souls call this city home, making it second in importance only to Bezantur as a Thayan port. Tharchion Hezass Nymar (NE male human Clr8 of Kossuth) allows life in Escalant to continue without much interference from Thay, other than the collection of taxes from the citizens. To that end, Nymar has stationed throughout the city several barracks of one hundred gnolls each. These Thayan brutes patrol the streets, occasionally taking the time to make an example out of some criminal or - worst of all - tax cheat.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Escalant (Large City): Magical/magical/nonstandard; AL NE/NE/CN; 40,000 gp limit; Assets 57,456,000 gp; Population 28,728; Mixea (human 82%, gnoll 5%, half-elf 5%, half-orc 5%, halfling 2%, other 1%).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Authority Figures: Hezass Nymar, NE male human Clr8 of Kossuth (tharchion of Lapendrar, lives in Eltabbar but has offices here); Curoz Falblat, NE male human Clr12 of Bane (leader of the largest temple of Bane in Thay); Purban Faltelfowe, CN male halfling Rog16 (leader of the Shadowmasters in Escalant).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Important Characters: Captain Kriben Vantur, LE male human Ftr16 (captain of the Tharchion&#39;s Guard); Helvarmad Elserme, CG male human Ftr4/Brd8 (an agent of the Simbul&#39;s Guard posing as a minor merchant to keep an eye on events in the city).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Tharchion&#39;s Guard: Ftr12, War11, War10, Ftr9, Ftr8, War8, Ftr7, War7 (2), Ftr6 (3), War6 (4), Ftr5 (4), War5 (10), Ftr4 (6), War4 (24), Ftr3 (9), War3 (70), Ftr2 (22), War2 (164), Ftr1 (53), War1 (497), gnolls without class levels (620); Militia: War4 (11), War3 (38), War2 (98), War1 (344).

However, Nethentir has not enjoyed the recent booming prosperity of Nethjet. While it has a port, no roads lead into the town. Still, some merchants forge their own overland paths from Thesk and beyond. The captains of Nethentir spend a great deal of their time ferrying goods back and forth from Nethjet to their homeport, but that&#39;s about as far as most of them go.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This has built up some resentment on the part of the citizens of Nethentir. However, many of them are just as happy not to have the increased attention of the Red Wizards that comes along with such wealth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Nethentir (Small Town): Magical; AL NE; 800 gp limit; Assets 74,880 gp; Population 1,872; Mixed (human 82%, gnoll 8%, orc 6%, half-orc 2%, halfling 2%).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Authority Figures: Prindentle Carh, NE male human Div6/Red4 (autharch of the town).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Important Characters: Kurgga Bloodfang, NE female gnoll Rgr4/Ftr4 (captain of the guard); Faxam Rul, CE male human fighter 4/rogue 4/Thayan slaver 5 (notorious raider of Thesk and lands beyond).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c19">Town Guard: War8, Ftr6, Ftr4, War4 (2), Ftr3 (2), War3 (6), Ftr2 (4), War2 (24), Ftr1 (7), Wan (60); Militia: War5, War2 (6), Com2 (6), War1 (23), Com1 (14); Other Characters: Bbn4, Bbn3 (2), Bbn2 (3), Bbn1 (6); Brd6, Brd5, Brd3, Brd2 (2), Brd1 (3); Clr7, Clr6, Clr4, Clr3 (3), Clr2 (4), Clr1 (5); Drd6, Drd3, Drd2; Ftr7, Ftr3, Ftr1 (2); Mnk5, Mnk1 (2); Rgr6, Rgr4, Rgr2 (2), Rgr1 (4); Rog7, Rog4, Rog1 (4); Sor4, Sor2, Sor1; Wiz8, Wiz7, Wiz4, Wiz3 (3), Wiz2 (4), Wiz1 (51; Adp3, Adp2 (2), Adp1 (9); Ari5, Ari4 (2), Ari3 (2), Ari2 (4), Ari1 (7); Exp9, Exp6, Exp5, Exp4 (3), Exp3 (4), Exp2 (8), Exp1 (49); War5, War4, War2 (3), War1 (2); Com7 (2), Com6, Com5 (2), Com4 (4), Com 3 (9), Com2 (20), Com1 (1,494).</span></p><h3 class="c8" id="h.ydd7hdykhuxm"><span class="c6">Nethjet (Large Town)</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This once-sleepy lake town used to be little more than the spot where the Eastern Way dead-ended at Lake Umber. Grain ships bound for Impiltur and other northerly lands took on their loads here, but for the most part, Nethjet saw little action except as the occasional launching point of yet another invasion into Aglarond by way of the Umber Marshes. Today, however, the tiny port here hustles with activity.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">While most of Thay&#39;s magic goods are exported through the great port of Bezantur on the southern coast, the growing trade in magic has opened up new markets for the country&#39;s older commodities, including cotton, fruit, and grain. The new Thay sends a great deal of traffic down the Umber, and Nethjet is the natural port for most ships that come and go from the region. Goods that travel the Umber into the Sea of Dlurg avoid the long and sometimes treacherous trip around the western tip of the Aglarondan peninsula.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Tharchion Nymar maintains a small palace in the center of the town, although he rarely travels to this sleepy corner of his tharch. In the past, he mostly used it as a base of operations to oversee the buildup and deployment of Thayan forces along the Aglarondan border. These days, he&#39;s more interested in the proper collection of taxes from the travelers passing through this now-booming port.</span></p><h2 class="c33 c19" id="h.n0nrb3qbhr97"><span class="c23 c32">Heroes and Monsters</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Thay is home to misbegotten monstrosities and sinister villains. The Red Wizards have bred horrible creatures for their nefarious purposes over the centuries, and the dungeons and pits of Thay are filled with their handiwork. In addition to monsters, Thay is also home to characters with abilities and skills found nowhere else in Faer&ucirc;n. Many are unrepentant villains who flourish in Thay&#39;s evil society, but others leave their forbidding homeland to seek adventure elsewhere in Faer&ucirc;n, and a few take up the dangerous, almost hopeless, struggle to bring about true and lasting change in their native land.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Humans are the most common race in Thay. Folk of other races such as dwarves, elves, or halflings simply don&#39;t exist except as slaves, and their lot is grim. Half-orcs, fire genasi, and tieflings are not uncommon, and the Thayans are reasonably open-minded about folk of such parentage, especially if they have Mulan blood in their veins.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c26 c34"></span></p></body></html>
