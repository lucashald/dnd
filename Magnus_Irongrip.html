    <h2>Physical Description</h2>
    <div class="info-box">
        <p>Magnus is a stout dwarf with the weathered appearance of one who has spent years at sea. His once-dark beard is now heavily streaked with grey, braided in the traditional style of Earthfast dwarves. Deep-set eyes the color of storm clouds carry both wisdom and sorrow, having witnessed the fall of his homeland.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Height:</strong> 4'6", broad-shouldered and sturdy</li>
            <li><strong>Build:</strong> Powerfully built, with the calloused hands of both a warrior and a sailor</li>
            <li><strong>Distinctive Features:</strong> Intricate braided beard with silver clan rings, a faded tattoo of Earthfast's seal on his right forearm, weathered sea-worn clothing</li>
            <li><strong>Typical Attire:</strong> Practical sailor's garb with a heavy sea cloak, leather boots reinforced for deck work, carries a well-worn lute across his back</li>
            <li><strong>Voice:</strong> Deep and resonant, with the accent of old Earthfast still strong despite years away</li>
            <li><strong>Mannerisms:</strong> Firm handshake that seems to assess character, tendency to hum old dwarven sailing songs, gazes at Giantspire Peak with a mix of pride and longing</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>The Fall of Earthfast</h2>

    <div class="tragedy-box">
        <h3>Five Years Ago: The Dragon's Wrath</h3>

        <p>Magnus's life changed forever when Putrifax, an ancient black dragon, descended upon Earthfast. The great dwarven city, carved deep into the mountains and standing for millennia, fell in a matter of days.</p>

        <h4>The Attack</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Putrifax's Assault:</strong> The dragon emerged from the depths, bringing devastation with acid and fury</li>
            <li><strong>The City's Fall:</strong> Earthfast's legendary defenses, built to withstand sieges by armies, crumbled before draconic might</li>
            <li><strong>The Evacuation:</strong> Magnus was among those who helped organize the desperate flight of survivors</li>
            <li><strong>The Loss:</strong> Thousands perished; the great forges went cold; centuries of dwarven culture reduced to rubble</li>
            <li><strong>The Diaspora:</strong> Survivors scattered across the realm, carrying what they could of their heritage</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Magnus's Escape</h4>
        <p>Magnus was leading a trade expedition when Putrifax attacked. Returning to find his home in ruins, he gathered what survivors he could find and used his ship to ferry them to safety. In those dark days, he acquired the vessel that would become the Silt Runner and took up the life of a wandering captain, unable to bear returning to what remained of Earthfast.</p>

        <h4>The Survivor's Burden</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Carries the weight of being among the few who survived</li>
            <li>Feels responsible for preserving Earthfast's memory and culture</li>
            <li>Songs and stories of his homeland have taken on new importance—they are now acts of remembrance</li>
            <li>Seeks news of other survivors and the dragon's current whereabouts</li>
            <li>Dreams of one day seeing Earthfast reclaimed, though he knows it may be impossible</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>The Silt Runner</h2>

    <div class="ship-box">
        <h3>Magnus's Ship</h3>

    </div>

    <h2>Heritage & Lineage</h2>

    <div class="heritage-box">
        <h3>Irongrip Clan of Earthfast</h3>

        <p>Magnus comes from an ancient and distinguished line. The Irongrip clan has been part of Earthfast since its founding, renowned for three things: their skill as warriors, their mastery of song and story, and their ancestral connection to Giantspire Peak.</p>

        <h4>The Dragon-Slayer's Line</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ancient Glory:</strong> Magnus's ancestor wielded Snowpiercer and slew the white dragon of Giantspire Peak ~700 years ago</li>
            <li><strong>The Lost Mine:</strong> His family established the great mine in Giantspire before losing it to orcs 500 years ago</li>
            <li><strong>Family Legacy:</strong> Each generation has preserved the songs and stories of that heroic age</li>
            <li><strong>The Spear's Mystery:</strong> Magnus knows family legends about Snowpiercer but not its current location</li>
            <li><strong>Last of the Line:</strong> Magnus may be the last living Irongrip, as far as he knows</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Bardic Tradition</h4>
        <p>The Irongrip clan maintained an unusual tradition for dwarves—bardic practice. They believed that great deeds deserved great songs, and that history lived through story and music. Magnus is the latest in this line, trained from youth in the lore and songs of his people.</p>

        <h4>What Magnus Knows</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Detailed oral histories of Giantspire Peak and the dragon slaying</li>
            <li>Songs containing clues to the old mine's layout and defenses</li>
            <li>Family legends about treasures and secrets left behind in the mountain</li>
            <li>The location of some (but not all) mine entrances</li>
            <li>Stories of what happened during the orc invasion</li>
            <li>Ancient dwarven techniques for metalwork and stonecraft from Earthfast</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Earthfast Relics</h4>
        <p>Magnus carries several items salvaged from Earthfast's ruins:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A clan banner, scorched but intact</li>
            <li>His father's signet ring bearing the Irongrip seal</li>
            <li>A book of songs and stories from the clan library</li>
            <li>Tools from the family forge</li>
            <li>A small stone carved with Earthfast's founding runes</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Harper Activities</h2>

    <div class="harper-box">
        <h3>Agent of the Harpers <span class="harper-symbol">♪</span></h3>

        <p>Magnus joined the Harpers in the aftermath of Earthfast's fall. The organization offered him purpose when his home was gone—a way to fight against tyranny and protect others from suffering the same fate his people endured.</p>

        <h4>Recruitment</h4>
        <p>A Harper agent named Skylark found Magnus in the refugee camps, recognizing both his skills and his burning need for purpose. Magnus proved a natural fit—his bardic abilities, sailing expertise, and network of contacts made him invaluable.</p>

        <h4>Current Mission</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Northern Watch:</strong> Monitor threats in the fjord regions and northern territories</li>
            <li><strong>Safe Passage:</strong> Transport Harper agents and refugees aboard the Silt Runner</li>

            <li><strong>Red Wizard Surveillance:</strong> Track Thayan activities, particularly around magical sites</li>
            <li><strong>Recruitment:</strong> Identify and vet potential Harper allies</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Harper Network</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Skylark:</strong> His recruiter and primary contact, based in Fjord's End</li>
            <li><strong>Coastal Agents:</strong> Network of informants in ports along his trade routes</li>
            <li><strong>Earthfast Survivors:</strong> Stays in contact with other refugees, some of whom are also Harpers</li>
            <li><strong>Regional Contacts:</strong> Knows Harper sympathizers throughout the north</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Methods & Approach</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses his cover as a merchant captain to move freely</li>
            <li>Gathers information through songs and stories in taverns</li>
            <li>Maintains plausible deniability—most see him as just a trader</li>
            <li>Cautious about revealing Harper connections to outsiders</li>
            <li>Assesses newcomers carefully before offering trust</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>The Song of Giantspire</h2>

    <div class="song-box">
        <h3>Magnus's Song</h3>
        <blockquote>
            The sight of the mountain seems to stir something in the ship's captain. Magnus starts to sing, his deep voice carrying across the water:
        </blockquote>

        <p><em>A traditional Irongrip clan song, passed down for seven centuries:</em></p>

        <p style="padding-left: 20px;">
            "High above the frozen waters,<br>
            Where the mist-crowned giant sleeps,<br>
            Irongrip's son faced the dragon,<br>
            In the mountain's ancient deeps.<br>
            <br>
            Snowpiercer true, forged in Earthfast,<br>
            Pierced the wyrm's cold heart of ice,<br>
            Mountain shook and glaciers trembled,<br>
            Paid in blood was freedom's price.<br>
            <br>
            Stone and silver, deep we delved there,<br>
            Halls of craft beneath the peak,<br>
            Till the green-skins came with fire,<br>
            And we lost what we did seek.<br>
            <br>
            But the mountain still remembers,<br>
            And the stones still bear our mark,<br>
            Irongrip's blood flows yet in me,<br>
            Guarding light against the dark."
        </p>

        <p><em>The song serves multiple purposes: it's a history lesson, a family record, and a promise that the Irongrip legacy endures.</em></p>

            <li><strong>The Binding:</strong> Has heard reports that Thayan wizards have enslaved the dragon</li>
            <li><strong>Irony of Fate:</strong> The dragon that destroyed his home may now be a weapon for an even greater evil</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Magnus's Dilemma</h4>
        <p>Magnus struggles with conflicting desires regarding Putrifax:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wants to see the dragon destroyed for what it did to Earthfast</li>
            <li>Recognizes he's not powerful enough to face such a creature</li>
            <li>Wonders if the dragon's enslavement by the Red Wizards is justice or a greater threat</li>
            <li>Fears what might happen if Putrifax breaks free of Thayan control</li>
            <li>Seeks powerful allies who might help him achieve vengeance</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Plot Hook</h4>
        <p>If the PCs prove trustworthy and capable, Magnus might reveal his connection to Putrifax and his desire to see the dragon destroyed. This could lead to missions investigating the dragon's current state, gathering intelligence on the Red Wizards, or even an eventual confrontation with the beast that destroyed Earthfast.</p>

            <strong>Meeting PCs for the first time:</strong><br>
            "Welcome aboard the Silt Runner. I'm Magnus Irongrip, her captain." <em>*extends hand for a firm handshake*</em> "Any friend of Skylark's has friends here. Come, we've the wind and the tide—let's put this port behind us."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>When asked about Earthfast:</strong><br>
            <em>*long pause, hand straying to his beard braids*</em> "Earthfast... was home. Greatest of dwarven cities, standing for three thousand years. Until five years ago, when Putrifax came from below. I... wasn't there when she fell. Part of me wishes I had been. The other part knows we needed survivors to remember." <em>*voice hardens*</em> "And to ensure the dragon pays for what it did."

        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>On his burden as last of his line:</strong><br>

            <li><strong>Earthfast Songs:</strong> Historical ballads and cultural songs from his homeland</li>
            <li><strong>Irongrip Clan Songs:</strong> Family histories, including the Song of Giantspire</li>

    <div class="npc-card">
        <h3>In Battle</h3>

        <h4>Fighting Style</h4>
        <p>While primarily a bard, Magnus is also a capable warrior in the dwarven tradition. He fights with:</p>

            <li><strong>Handaxe:</strong> For throwing or close work</li>
            <li><strong>Crossbow:</strong> Practical for shipboard combat</li>
            <li><strong>Bardic Magic:</strong> Supports allies and hinders enemies with spells</li>

            <li>Fights defensively, protecting those under his care</li>
            <li>Saves his most powerful magic for critical moments</li>
            <li>Will retreat if it saves lives, but never abandons his people</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Limitations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Not built for frontline combat despite dwarven resilience</li>
            <li>Magic is moderate-level; he's not a powerhouse spellcaster</li>
            <li>Age and experience make him cautious, not reckless</li>
            <li>Protective nature can be exploited by threatening others</li>
        </ul>
