      <h2>Appearance</h2>
      <p>
        Rolan is lean with sunburned skin and quick, restless hands. He keeps his dark hair cropped short
        and wears a battered fisherman's jacket patched with mismatched cloth. A thin scar runs from his left eyebrow
        toward his temple — the kind of small injury acquired in a scuffle or a clumsy fall off a dock.
      </p>

      <h2>Personality</h2>
      <p>
        Outwardly brash and often rude, Rolan delights in sarcasm and pushing people's buttons. He talks fast,
        laughs too loudly, and has little patience for authority or sentiment. Still, his rudeness is as much a
        shield as a weapon — he rarely lets anyone see past the attitude to the quieter, anxious person beneath.
      </p>

      <h2>Secrets</h2>
      <p>
        Unknown to most, Rolan writes short letters to his cousin who lives in Gnomengarde. In those letters he
        reports sightings, rumors, and the movements of people he suspects are associated with the Harpers. He
        claims it's for coin and favor, but the tone of some lines suggests he is more worried than mercenary.
      </p>

      <h2>Motivations & Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep his place in the harbor and avoid trouble with the town guard.</li>
        <li>Keep his cousin safe and in good standing in Gnomengarde (the letters help fund the cousin's tinkering).</li>
        <li>Maintain a precarious balance of being useful to secret contacts while staying beneath notice.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hooks for Adventures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If the PCs need information about movements on the docks, Rolan can be bribed or coerced into talking.</li>
        <li>Someone discovers a draft of a letter that hints Rolan's reports; the Harpers (or their enemies) may come asking.</li>
        <li>Rolan is threatened by a local thug for unpaid debts — the PCs can intervene and gain a wary informant.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Suggested Stats (5e NPC)</h2>

      </table>

      <h2>Roleplaying Tips</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Answer questions tersely and with a smirk. Make rude jokes but reveal small helpful details when properly prompted.</li>
        <li>Fidget with a scrap of string or a ring while talking; nervous tics show when he mentions his cousin or letters.</li>
        <li>If threatened, try to talk his way out before drawing a knife — he prefers running or bargaining to fighting.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Letter Examples</h2>
      <p>Here are two short excerpts of his correspondence (use as clues or props):</p>
      <blockquote>
        "R: Saw a woman with a raven pin near the boathouse. Not one of ours, I think, but she asked about the lighthouse. Quiet fellow with her — maybe guard. If they ask, say I saw nothing. -R"
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "Cousin — I double-checked that chest by the cove. Empty now. If anyone asks I buried it under the old piling. Hope your new gears ship soon; the fish smell like metal when I think too hard. -R"
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Where to Find Him</h2>
      <p>Most mornings he's mending nets on the eastern pier. Late evenings he favors the tavern to drink and pick fights with sailors.</p>
