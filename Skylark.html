    <h2>Background</h2>
    <div class="info-box">
        <p>Skylark is a seasoned Harper agent operating in the northern reaches of the region. Known for his keen observational skills and deep knowledge of the wilderness, he has established Fjord's End as one of his primary bases of operation. His network extends throughout the region, with contacts in various settlements and communities.</p>

        <p>Skylark's true nature as a druid is carefully concealed. To most observers, including many townspeople, he appears to be a skilled ranger—a wanderer who braves the harsh northern elements with practical gear and keen wilderness knowledge. In truth, Skylark's command of natural magic and his deep spiritual connection to the land provide far more protection than mundane clothing. His apparent lack of heavy cold-weather gear often goes unquestioned due to his mastery of druidic magic and the magical artifacts he wears.</p>

        <p>As a druid, Skylark combines his communion with nature, his command of natural magic, and his deep Harper ideals of gathering intelligence, opposing tyranny, and protecting the innocent. He has been instrumental in monitoring the activities of the Red Wizards of Thay and other threats to the region's stability. His druidic nature gives him unique insights into unnatural disturbances and supernatural dangers threatening the balance of the land.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Appearance & Deception</h2>
    <div class="stat-block">
        <p><strong>Visual Impression:</strong> Skylark appears to be a typical northern ranger—practical clothing, well-worn gear, and the bearing of someone who spends more time in the wilderness than civilization. Most would not give him a second glance beyond noting his competence and self-sufficiency.</p>

        <p><strong>Notable Detail - The Ring:</strong> The most distinctive thing about Skylark, to those who look closely, is a subtle ring he wears on his left hand. This is his <strong>Ring of Warmth</strong>, a magical artifact that maintains a comfortable temperature around him. Those who know what to look for recognize it as a sign of magical expertise—though they might assume it belongs to a ranger who found it or acquired it through adventure.</p>

        <p><strong>Missing Cold Weather Gear:</strong> Observant individuals may notice that despite the harsh northern climate, Skylark rarely wears heavy furs, multiple layers, or the usual cold-weather equipment other travelers rely upon. When asked about this apparent oversight, he attributes it to his toughness, good health, or simply being well-acclimated to the north. In truth, the Ring of Warmth (combined with his druidic resilience) makes such mundane protections unnecessary.</p>

        <p><strong>The Deception:</strong> Skylark deliberately maintains the "ranger" appearance to avoid drawing attention to his true nature as a druid. Druids in the region are often associated with the Circle of Leth and its opposition to settlements and commerce. By appearing as a ranger rather than a druid, Skylark can move through trading towns and settlements without triggering suspicion or conflict. Only those he explicitly reveals his true nature to understand that his power comes from communion with nature itself, not ranger skills.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Personality & Traits</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Observant:</strong> Little escapes Skylark's notice, whether in the wilderness or in social situations</li>
        <li><strong>Cautious:</strong> Years of covert operations have made him careful about revealing information</li>
        <li><strong>Loyal:</strong> Fiercely devoted to the Harper cause and those he considers allies</li>
        <li><strong>Resourceful:</strong> Makes use of every tool at his disposal, including his animal companion</li>
        <li><strong>Patient:</strong> Willing to observe and wait for the right moment to act</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Animal Companion: Adam</h2>
    <div class="companion-box">
        <h3>Adam the Raven</h3>
        <p><strong>Species:</strong> Raven (Corvus corax)</p>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Scout, messenger, and Skylark's eyes and ears</p>

        <h4>Characteristics</h4>

        </ul>

        <h4>Typical Behavior</h4>
        <p>Adam is frequently seen perching on the pier at Fjord's End, watching ships arrive. To the casual observer, he appears to be just another raven, but those who know Skylark recognize Adam as an extension of the ranger's vigilance. The raven's presence often signals that Skylark is aware of new arrivals, even when the ranger himself is not immediately visible.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "A raven perches on the pier, watching your arrival."
        </blockquote>

    </div>

    <h2>Relationship with Fjord's End</h2>
    <div class="info-box">
        <p>Skylark has cultivated Fjord's End as more than just a base of operations—he genuinely cares about the settlement and its inhabitants. The village's isolated location makes it ideal for covert Harper activities, while its natural defenses and loyal population make it a potential safe haven for those fleeing persecution or tyranny.</p>

        <p>The locals know Skylark as a helpful ranger who warns them of dangers and occasionally brings trade or travelers their way. Most don't know about his Harper affiliation, seeing him simply as a protector of the region. Only Magnus Irongrip and perhaps a few other trusted individuals know his true role.</p>
    </div>
