    <blockquote>
        Towering limestone pillars rise from the earth like petrified trees, creating a labyrinth of stone that stretches for miles. Sharp, jagged formations reach toward the sky, some as tall as castle towers, their surfaces weathered by millennia into strange shapes and patterns. Narrow passages wind between the pillars, creating a maze where the sun rarely touches the ground. In the heart of this geological wonder stands a broken jade archway, its fragments still pulsing with faint residual magic—all that remains of one of the greatest druidic rituals ever performed.

    <h2>Geography & Features</h2>
    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>The Stone Pillars</h3>
        <p>The Stone Forest resembles the famous karst formations of Shilin, China—thousands of limestone pillars thrust upward from the earth in dramatic, blade-like formations. The pillars range from 15 to 100 feet in height, creating a vertical maze that disorients travelers and blocks sightlines.</p>

        <h4>Natural Characteristics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Formation:</strong> Created over millions of years by erosion of an ancient limestone plateau</li>
            <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Grey-white stone pillars with sharp edges, weathered into fantastical shapes</li>
            <li><strong>Passages:</strong> Narrow corridors between pillars, some barely wide enough for a person</li>
            <li><strong>Caves:</strong> Extensive underground cave system beneath the forest</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetation:</strong> Sparse—moss, lichens, and hardy shrubs that cling to stone crevices</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Underground streams, occasional pools in depressions between pillars</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Magical Alterations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Jade Veins:</strong> Thin veins of jade run through many pillars, remnants of the druidic ritual</li>
            <li><strong>Resonance:</strong> Some pillars hum or vibrate with residual magic</li>
            <li><strong>Corruption:</strong> Areas tainted by Putrifax's presence—acidic pools, withered stone</li>
            <li><strong>Thayan Modifications:</strong> Carved runes, magical sensors, trapped areas</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>History & Timeline</h2>

    <div class="timeline">
        <h3>Chronicle of the Stone Forest</h3>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <strong>~3000 years ago - Natural Formation:</strong>
            <p>The Stone Forest exists as a natural geological wonder. Local tribes consider it sacred, believing spirits dwell within the stone pillars.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <strong>~2100 years ago - Druidic Discovery:</strong>
            <p>A powerful druid circle discovers the Stone Forest and recognizes its potential as a site of immense natural power. The limestone formations create natural ley line convergences, making it ideal for large-scale rituals.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <strong>~2000 years ago - The Dragon's Rampage:</strong>
            <p>Putrifax, an ancient black dragon of terrifying power, lays waste to numerous settlements and kingdoms. Conventional armies cannot stop the creature. The dragon's acid breath and cunning make it nearly invincible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <strong>~2000 years ago - The Great Imprisonment:</strong>
            <p>Unable to slay Putrifax, an alliance of druids performs an epic ritual lasting nine days and nine nights. Using massive quantities of jade—sacred to the druids and anathema to corruption—they construct an archway at the heart of the Stone Forest. The Imprisonment spell seals Putrifax within the earth beneath the jade archway, bound in magical stone and unable to escape.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <strong>~2000-36 years ago - The Long Sleep:</strong>
            <p>Putrifax remains imprisoned for nearly two millennia. The druid circle maintains guardianship over the site, though their order gradually diminishes over the centuries. The Stone Forest becomes known as a cursed place, avoided by travelers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <strong>~50 years ago - Thayan Interest:</strong>
            <p>Red Wizards of Thay begin researching ancient sites of power. Spies and scholars learn legends of the imprisoned dragon and the jade archway. They see an opportunity to claim an ancient, powerful creature as a weapon.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <strong>36 years ago - The Breaking:</strong>
            <p>A Thayan expedition, led by powerful necromancers and transmuters, arrives at the Stone Forest. They overwhelm the few remaining druid guardians and begin a ritual to dispel the ancient Imprisonment. After weeks of work, they shatter the jade archway and break the binding. Putrifax awakens, enraged and hungry after two thousand years of confinement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <strong>36 years ago - The Binding:</strong>
            <p>The Red Wizards reveal their true plan—they use the moment of Putrifax's weakness (disoriented from millennia of imprisonment) to enact their own binding ritual. Through necromantic magic and domination spells, they enslave the dragon to their will. Putrifax becomes a weapon of Thay.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <strong>5 years ago - Attack on Earthfast:</strong>
            <p>Under Thayan command, Putrifax destroys the dwarven city of Earthfast. Magnus Irongrip survives and becomes one of the few witnesses to the dragon's current enslaved state.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-entry">
            <strong>Present Day - Contested Ground:</strong>
            <p>The Red Wizards maintain a presence at the Stone Forest, using it as an outpost and research site. They study the broken ritual and remnant jade magic, seeking to understand ancient druidic power. Harper agents, including Skylark, monitor the site from a distance.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>The Jade Archway</h2>

    <div class="jade-box">
        <h3>Heart of the Imprisonment</h3>

        <blockquote>
            At the center of the Stone Forest stands what remains of the great jade archway. Once, it rose twenty feet high, carved from solid jade and inscribed with druidic runes of binding and protection. Now it lies in pieces, its fragments scattered across the central clearing. The largest piece—half of the arch's crown—remains upright, embedded in the stone. Even broken, it radiates faint magical energy, a pale echo of the power it once contained.
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Original Construction</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Material:</strong> Approximately 50 tons of pure jade, sourced from sacred quarries across the continent</li>
            <li><strong>Size:</strong> 20 feet tall, 15 feet wide, 3 feet thick at the base</li>
            <li><strong>Runes:</strong> Thousands of druidic symbols of binding, earth, and imprisonment</li>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> Served as the focal point for the Imprisonment spell, anchoring Putrifax beneath the earth</li>
            <li><strong>Power Source:</strong> Drew on natural ley line convergences beneath the Stone Forest</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Current State</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Destruction:</strong> Shattered by Thayan counter-ritual 36 years ago</li>
            <li><strong>Fragments:</strong> Largest pieces remain on-site; smaller fragments scattered or claimed by Thayans</li>
            <li><strong>Residual Magic:</strong> Still radiates abjuration and transmutation magic (detectable with Detect Magic)</li>
            <li><strong>Corruption:</strong> Some pieces show signs of acidic damage from Putrifax's presence</li>
            <li><strong>Value:</strong> Jade fragments are extremely valuable—both monetarily and magically</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Magical Properties</h4>
        <p>The jade fragments retain traces of the original ritual's power:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can be used as material components for powerful abjuration spells</li>
            <li>Resist corruption and necromantic magic</li>
            <li>Resonate in the presence of draconic magic</li>
            <li>May reveal visions of the past when properly attuned</li>
            <li>Small fragments are worth 50-200 gp; large pieces worth thousands</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>The Druidic Prison</h2>

    <div class="druid-box">
        <h3>The Great Imprisonment Ritual</h3>

        <p>The ritual that bound Putrifax was one of the most ambitious druidic workings ever attempted, requiring the cooperation of multiple druid circles and taking years to prepare.</p>

        <h4>The Druid Alliance</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Circle of the Stone:</strong> Earth druids who understood the geological power of the Stone Forest</li>
            <li><strong>Circle of the Jade Serpent:</strong> Masters of jade magic and mineral lore</li>
            <li><strong>Circle of Ancient Roots:</strong> Specialists in binding and imprisonment magics</li>
            <li><strong>Wildshape Guardians:</strong> Druids who took permanent guardian forms to watch over the prison</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Nine-Day Ritual</h4>
        <p>The imprisonment required:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>36 druids of significant power (four circles of nine)</li>
            <li>Alignment with celestial and terrestrial power nodes</li>
            <li>The construction of the jade archway as a physical anchor</li>
            <li>The sacrifice of the lead druid's mortal form to power the binding</li>
            <li>Constant chanting and ritual work for nine consecutive days and nights</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Spell's Mechanism</h4>
        <p>The Imprisonment spell used a unique variant:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Minimus Containment combined with Entombment</li>
            <li><strong>Prison:</strong> Putrifax was shrunk and sealed within a jade stone beneath the archway, then that stone was entombed in solid rock 100 feet underground</li>
            <li><strong>Failsafes:</strong> Multiple layers of binding prevented escape even if one layer failed</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Intended to last "until the stars fall and the earth breaks"—essentially permanent</li>
            <li><strong>Weakness:</strong> Could be dispelled, but would require immense magical power and knowledge of the original ritual</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Guardians</h4>
        <p>After the ritual, guardian druids remained:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some took the form of stone or ancient trees, merging with the forest itself</li>
            <li>Others maintained a monastery nearby (now ruins)</li>
            <li>Successive generations became fewer as the imprisonment seemed permanent</li>
            <li>By the time the Thayans arrived, only a handful of guardians remained</li>
            <li>The last guardian druids died defending the archway 36 years ago</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>The Thayan Conquest</h2>

    <div class="thayan-box">
        <h3>Red Wizard Occupation</h3>

        <p>Thirty-six years ago, the Red Wizards of Thay executed a carefully planned operation to claim Putrifax as a weapon.</p>

        <h4>The Breaking Ritual</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Three weeks of concentrated magical work</li>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> Systematic dispelling of the layered wards, culminating in shattering the jade archway</li>
            <li><strong>Participants:</strong> 12 Red Wizards (specialists in necromancy, transmutation, and abjuration)</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> 4 Red Wizards died in the process, consumed by backlash from the broken ritual</li>
            <li><strong>Success:</strong> Putrifax released from imprisonment, disoriented and weakened</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Enslavement</h4>
        <p>The moment Putrifax broke free, the Thayans enacted their true plan:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Used the dragon's moment of weakness to bind it with necromantic chains</li>
            <li>Employed domination magic to break its will</li>
            <li>Created a phylactery-like control mechanism to ensure obedience</li>
            <li>Transported Putrifax to Thayan territory for further conditioning</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Current Thayan Presence</h4>
        <p>The Red Wizards maintain the Stone Forest as a research outpost:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personnel:</strong> 2-4 Red Wizards at any given time, plus guards and apprentices</li>
            <li><strong>Total Forces:</strong> 20-30 individuals (wizards, guards, researchers, servants)</li>
            <li><strong>Fortification:</strong> Central compound built around the broken jade archway</li>
            <li><strong>Research:</strong> Studying druidic magic, jade properties, and ancient binding rituals</li>
            <li><strong>Patrols:</strong> Regular sweeps of the Stone Forest to deter intruders</li>
            <li><strong>Defenses:</strong> Magical wards, traps, summoned creatures, undead guardians</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Why They Stay</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The broken jade archway contains valuable magical knowledge</li>
            <li>Studying the druidic ritual helps them maintain control over Putrifax</li>
            <li>The site serves as a forward outpost in the region</li>
            <li>Residual magical energy makes it useful for certain rituals and experiments</li>
            <li>Prevents others from claiming the jade fragments or learning what happened</li>
        </ul>
