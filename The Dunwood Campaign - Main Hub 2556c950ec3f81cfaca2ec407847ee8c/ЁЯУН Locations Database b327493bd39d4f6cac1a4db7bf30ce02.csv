Damara,"In 1492 DR, Damara is a constitutional monarchy in the Cold Lands of northeastern Faerûn, ruled by Queen Concettina Delcasio since 1487 DR. The kingdom is politically stable but faces significant external threats from the expansionist Warlock Knights of Vaasa, who have sealed the Bloodstone Pass, disrupting trade and increasing military tensions. Internally, Damara is governed by a council of nobles with constitutional limits on royal power, and the capital has returned to Helgabal. The kingdom maintains strong trade with Impiltur, relies on local militias for defense, and is a key ally for Harper operations in the region.",,,,,Settlement
