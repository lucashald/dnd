        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Background & History</h2>

    <div class="thayan-box">
        <h3>Rise Through Thayan Ranks</h3>
        <p>Thessarian was born to a minor noble family in Eltabbar, showing magical aptitude at age seven. His parents eagerly enrolled him in the Academy of Shapers and Binders, hoping to elevate the family's status through his success.</p>

        <h4>Early Career</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Age 15:</strong> Accepted into formal Red Wizard training in Conjuration</li>
            <li><strong>Age 22:</strong> Earned the title of Red Wizard after successfully binding a pit fiend (with significant supervision)</li>
            <li><strong>Age 28:</strong> Assigned to northern operations, proving his worth in several skirmishes by summoning aerial support</li>
            <li><strong>Age 35:</strong> First participated in the annual dragon binding ritual</li>
            <li><strong>Age 42-47:</strong> Has participated in the ritual for five consecutive years, never successfully controlling Putrifax</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Specializations</h4>

            <li>Expert in planar binding and summoning extraplanar creatures</li>
            <li>Skilled at creating lasting magical bonds and control effects</li>
            <li>Knowledgeable about draconic psychology and resistance to magic</li>
            <li>Competent teleportation caster for rapid deployment</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>School of Magic: Conjuration</h2>

    <div class="magic-box">
        <h3>Mastery of Summoning & Binding</h3>

        <p>As a specialist in Conjuration, Thessarian has dedicated his life to mastering the art of calling forth creatures and bending them to his will. His approach is methodical and academic, treating bound creatures as tools rather than allies.</p>

        <h4>Signature Abilities</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Benign Transposition:</strong> Can teleport up to 30 feet as an action, or swap places with a willing creature</li>
            <li><strong>Focused Conjuration:</strong> Concentration on conjuration spells cannot be broken by taking damage</li>
            <li><strong>Durable Summons:</strong> Creatures he summons have additional hit points</li>
            <li><strong>Ritual Expertise:</strong> Particularly skilled at lengthy, complex summoning rituals</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Preferred Spells</h4>
        <p><strong>Signature Summons:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Summon Greater Demon</em> - His go-to combat spell</li>
            <li><em>Conjure Elemental</em> - For utility and battlefield control</li>
            <li><em>Planar Binding</em> - His specialty, used to create long-term servitors</li>
            <li><em>Gate</em> - The pinnacle of his ambitions (not yet mastered)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Control & Binding:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Geas</em> - Used in the dragon binding ritual</li>
            <li><em>Dominate Monster</em> - Backup control option</li>
            <li><em>Magic Circle</em> - Protection during dangerous summonings</li>
            <li><em>Dimension Door</em> - For rapid escape if bindings fail</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Research Focus</h4>
        <p>Currently studying methods to strengthen geas spells specifically against dragons. Has filled seventeen journals with notes on Putrifax's resistances and theories about overcoming them.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Dragon Binding Ritual</h2>

    <div class="journal-entry">
        <h3>From the Journal of Thessarian Vekt</h3>
        <p><em>15th Day of Nightal, 1492 DR</em></p>

        <p>The ritual is concluded, and once again I am denied what should rightfully be mine. Tharchion Nyth controls Putrifax for another year, the third consecutive term for that ambitious viper. I suspect she has been bribing the other participants—there is no other explanation for how her geas took hold so readily when mine failed to penetrate the beast's defenses yet again.</p>

        <p>Seven days we stood in that circle, the cold wind cutting through our robes as we chanted in shifts. Putrifax glared at us with those sulfurous eyes, acid dripping from her maw onto the frozen ground where it hissed and steamed. The ancient wyrm knows exactly what we're doing, of course. She's older than any of us by centuries, and her hatred burns as hot as her breath is corrosive. When Kasec the Transmuter stepped too close on the fourth day, she nearly took his head off—only the previous year's binding held her back, and barely.</p>

        <p>The dragon's resistance grows stronger each year. Where once we could renew the geas in a day or two, now it takes nearly a tenday of constant casting. Her will is formidable, even for a beast. I counted at least forty-seven failed attempts before Nyth's spell finally took hold. The creature actually laughed when my own casting shattered against her mind like glass against stone.</p>

        <p>But I have learned much from observing the process. Next year, I will prepare differently. The spell requires not just power, but perfect timing—striking when the dragon's defenses are worn thin from previous attempts. Nyth succeeded because she waited, watching the rest of us exhaust ourselves and Putrifax's resistance alike. Cunning, I'll grant her that.</p>

        <p>The political implications trouble me more than the magical ones. With Putrifax under her command, Nyth controls the most powerful weapon in our northern operations. The dragon's mere presence keeps the barbarian tribes in line, and her mobility allows us to strike anywhere along the Sword Coast within days. Szass Tam himself takes notice of whoever holds the beast's leash.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ambitious:</strong> Hungers for power and recognition, frustrated by repeated failures</li>
            <li><strong>Calculating:</strong> Weighs every action and word for political advantage</li>
            <li><strong>Meticulous:</strong> Takes extensive notes, analyzes everything obsessively</li>
            <li><strong>Bitter:</strong> Growing resentful of Tharchion Nyth's success</li>
            <li><strong>Academic:</strong> Genuinely fascinated by magical theory, sometimes to his detriment</li>

            <li><strong>Paranoid:</strong> Suspects others of cheating or sabotage when he fails</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Quirks & Mannerisms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Drums fingers when thinking or irritated</li>
            <li>Quotes arcane texts to support his arguments</li>
            <li>Keeps meticulous journals, writes in them daily</li>

            <li>Adjusts his rings constantly when nervous</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Motivations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Goal:</strong> Control Putrifax in the next annual binding ritual</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Goal:</strong> Gain recognition from Szass Tam</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term Ambition:</strong> Rise to Tharchion or Zulkir status</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Drive:</strong> Prove his magical prowess exceeds Nyth's</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Interest:</strong> Master dragon psychology and will-breaking techniques</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Relationships & Politics</h2>

    <div class="ambition-box">
        <h3>Key Connections</h3>

        <h4>Tharchion Nyth (Rival)</h4>
        <p>His primary competitor and source of frustration. Thessarian suspects (possibly incorrectly) that she bribes other participants or uses political influence rather than pure magical skill. His resentment grows with each year she controls the dragon.</p>

        <h4>Kasec the Transmuter (Colleague)</h4>
        <p>Fellow ritual participant. Thessarian views him as somewhat reckless after the near-miss on day four of the last ritual. Possible ally if approached correctly, as Kasec also failed to bind Putrifax.</p>

        <h4>Other Ritual Participants</h4>
        <p>Five other Red Wizards participate in the annual binding. Thessarian suspects several of being in Nyth's pocket, though he lacks proof.</p>

        <h4>Szass Tam (Distant Superior)</h4>
        <p>The Zulkir of Necromancy and ruler of Thay. Thessarian desperately wants his recognition but has never directly interacted with him. Believes controlling Putrifax would earn Szass Tam's notice.</p>

        <h4>Stone Forest Garrison</h4>
        <p>Commands respect from the Thayan forces at the Stone Forest outpost but is not particularly well-liked. They find him arrogant and out-of-touch with practical concerns.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Current Activities</h2>

    <div class="thayan-box">
        <h3>Present Assignments</h3>

        <h4>At the Stone Forest</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Supervises research into the broken druidic imprisonment ritual</li>
            <li>Studies jade fragments and their binding properties</li>
            <li>Seeks any knowledge that might help him control Putrifax</li>
            <li>Maintains summoned and bound guardians for the outpost</li>
            <li>Coordinates with other Red Wizards on northern operations</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Preparation for Next Ritual</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Developing new variations of geas specifically against dragons</li>
            <li>Researching Putrifax's true name (believes it would grant control)</li>
            <li>Experimenting with timing and approach based on last year's observations</li>
            <li>Gathering exotic spell components that might strengthen his binding</li>
            <li>Building political alliances to counter Nyth's influence</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Secret Project</h4>
        <p>Unknown to most, Thessarian is attempting to develop a modified version of the ancient druidic imprisonment that originally bound Putrifax. He believes combining jade magic with his own conjuration expertise might create an unbreakable binding. This research is technically unauthorized and potentially dangerous.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Combat Abilities</h2>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>In Battle</h3>

        <h4>Tactics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Begins combat by summoning powerful creatures (demons or elementals)</li>
            <li>Uses Benign Transposition to maintain distance from melee combatants</li>
            <li>Focuses on control and binding spells rather than direct damage</li>
            <li>Has prepared escape routes via Dimension Door or teleportation circles</li>
            <li>Fights tactically, viewing battle as a chess match</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Signature Combat Spells</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Summon Greater Demon:</strong> His opening move in serious combat</li>
            <li><strong>Wall of Force:</strong> For battlefield control and protection</li>
            <li><strong>Counterspell:</strong> Used liberally to disrupt enemy casters</li>
            <li><strong>Dimension Door:</strong> Primary escape mechanism</li>
            <li><strong>Cloudkill:</strong> Area denial when needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Physically frail—avoids melee at all costs</li>
            <li>Overconfident in his summoned creatures' abilities</li>
            <li>May underestimate non-magical threats</li>
            <li>Emotionally triggered by mentions of his failures with Putrifax</li>
            <li>Focused on escape over last stands—will flee if battle turns against him</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Plot Hooks & Adventure Ideas</h2>

    <div class="session-note">
        <h3>Ways to Involve Thessarian</h3>

        <h4>The Desperate Deal</h4>
        <p>Thessarian, frustrated by repeated failures, might approach the PCs (or be approached by them) with a risky proposal: help him gain control of Putrifax, and he'll use the dragon to accomplish something beneficial (destroy a mutual enemy, prevent a catastrophe, etc.). Can the PCs trust a Red Wizard's word?</p>

        <h4>Journal Theft</h4>
        <p>Harper agents (possibly through Magnus or Skylark) task PCs with stealing Thessarian's journals. His notes on the dragon binding ritual could reveal how to free Putrifax from Thayan control—or how to destroy the dragon entirely.</p>

        <h4>Research Rivalry</h4>
        <p>PCs investigating the Stone Forest might capture Thessarian's attention when they demonstrate knowledge of the druidic imprisonment. He might offer information in exchange for help with his secret research—creating a dangerous alliance of convenience.</p>

        <h4>The Binding Ritual</h4>
        <p>High-level campaign: PCs must disrupt the annual dragon binding ritual. Thessarian, bitter about his repeated failures, might be convinced to sabotage the ceremony from within—for the right price or leverage.</p>

        <h4>Summoning Gone Wrong</h4>
        <p>One of Thessarian's experimental summonings breaks free of his control, threatening nearby settlements. PCs must deal with the creature while Thessarian tries to recapture it before his failure becomes public knowledge.</p>

        <h4>Political Pawn</h4>
        <p>Thessarian's rivalry with Nyth creates an exploitable weakness. PCs working against the Thayans might use this rivalry to turn the Red Wizards against each other, feeding misinformation or staging false-flag operations.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Roleplaying Thessarian</h2>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Voice & Mannerisms</h3>

        <h4>Speech Patterns</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Speaks precisely and deliberately, weighing every word</li>
            <li>Uses academic language and arcane terminology</li>
            <li>Frequently cites magical texts and theorems</li>
            <li>Becomes more clipped and curt when irritated</li>
            <li>Tends to lecture rather than converse</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Sample Dialogue</h4>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Meeting PCs at the Stone Forest:</strong><br>
            "You trespass on Thayan territory. Normally this would result in immediate... consequences. However, you've piqued my curiosity. How did you penetrate our wards? The specifics, if you please. Depending on your answer, I may let you leave with all your appendages intact."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>When questioned about Putrifax:</strong><br>
            <em>*fingers drum on table three times*</em> "The dragon is... a complex matter. Powerful, yes. Ancient, certainly. Currently under proper Thayan authority. Why do you ask?" <em>*eyes narrow suspiciously*</em>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>If his failures are mentioned:</strong><br>
            <em>*voice goes cold*</em> "Careful. You speak of matters beyond your comprehension. The binding of an ancient wyrm is not some hedge wizard's parlor trick. It requires... precise timing. Perfect circumstances. Which certain individuals seem to arrange for themselves through means other than pure magical skill."
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <strong>Making a deal:</strong><br>
            "I am not unreasonable. We both want something, yes? Then let us be civilized about this. You assist me with a certain... research problem, and I ensure you leave the Stone Forest alive and unmolested. I may even share certain information about our operations. Within limits, of course."
        </blockquote>

            <li><strong>Uneasy Ally:</strong> His desperation and rivalry create opportunities for deals</li>
