    <h2>Background & Origins</h2>

    <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #e6e6fa; border-left: 4px solid #9370db;">
        <h3>The Evanara Sisters</h3>
        <p>Elder sister to <a href="Iawynn_Evanara.html" style="color: #4682b4; font-weight: bold;">Iawynn Evanara</a>, Tyrael has walked the world for two centuries. Born on the mystical island of Evermeet, sacred homeland of the elves, she and her younger sister relocated to Silverymoon when Iawynn was still a child by elven standards. There, amidst the Silver Marches, they both found their callings—Iawynn to the sacred light of Selûne, and Tyrael to the shadows where the Harpers work.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Star Elf Heritage</h3>
    <div class="npc-card">
        <h4>The Mithral Elves</h4>
        <p>Star elves, also called mithral elves, are a rare and reclusive subrace. They possess:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Evermeet, the sacred elven isle hidden from mortal maps</li>
            <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Pale, almost luminous skin with silver or white hair, eyes that reflect starlight</li>
            <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Deeply contemplative, with strong connections to the stars and celestial magic</li>
            <li><strong>Rarity:</strong> Few star elves leave Evermeet; even fewer are known on the mainland</li>
            <li><strong>Culture:</strong> Scholarly, mystical, often practitioners of rare magical arts</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The Move to Silverymoon:</strong> When Iawynn was young (~80 years ago), the sisters relocated to Silverymoon in the Silver Marches. The reasons for leaving Evermeet remain part of the family's private history, but Silverymoon's reputation as a center of learning and tolerance made it an ideal new home.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h2>The War of the Silver Marches</h2>

    <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #ffe4e1; border-left: 4px solid #dc143c;">
        <h3>Battle-Tested Sisters</h3>
        <p>When the orc hordes descended upon the Silver Marches in recent years, both Evanara sisters answered the call to defend their adopted homeland. The war tested them in different ways:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Iawynn:</strong> Fought openly as a Selunite paladin, her silver armor shining on the battlefield, a beacon of hope to defenders</li>
            <li><strong>Tyrael:</strong> Operated in the shadows—eliminating orc leaders, gathering intelligence, sabotaging supply lines with psychic blades that left no trace</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The War's Legacy:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Forged the sisters' bond through shared combat and loss</li>
            <li>Demonstrated Tyrael's effectiveness as a Harper agent</li>
            <li>Proved Iawynn's devotion to Selûne and her order</li>
            <li>Earned both sisters respect and recognition in the Silver Marches</li>
            <li>Deepened their commitment to protecting the innocent from darkness</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h2>Psionic Powers</h2>

    <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #f0f8ff; border-left: 4px solid #4682b4;">
        <h3>Mind Over Matter</h3>
        <p>Tyrael's psionic abilities are rare in Faerûn, poorly understood by most, and feared by many. She learned these mysterious powers from the <strong>Wood Elves of the Moonwood</strong>, an ancient forest in the Silver Marches. Among those reclusive elves, she discovered teachers who recognized her latent psychic potential and trained her in the way of the mind blade.</p>

        <h4>Training in the Moonwood</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> The Moonwood, a vast and ancient forest in the Silver Marches</li>
            <li><strong>Teachers:</strong> Wood Elf psionic masters, practitioners of an old and secret tradition</li>
            <li><strong>Years of Study:</strong> Decades of discipline and mental training</li>
            <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> The mind as weapon, thought as shield, will as armor</li>
            <li><strong>Secrecy:</strong> The wood elves guard this knowledge jealously; few outsiders ever learn</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Why Psionics Are Rare</h4>
        <div class="npc-card">
            <p>Unlike arcane or divine magic, psionics draw upon the power of the mind itself. In Faerûn:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Poorly Understood:</strong> Most wizards and clerics have no framework for understanding psionic power</li>
                <li><strong>Feared:</strong> The ability to read minds, dominate thoughts, and manifest weapons from pure will unsettles people</li>
                <li><strong>Rare:</strong> Few possess the natural talent, and fewer still find teachers</li>
                <li><strong>Mysterious:</strong> Psionic traditions are scattered, hidden, or lost to history</li>
                <li><strong>Unpredictable Edge:</strong> Opponents familiar with magic are utterly unprepared for psionics</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>The Psychic Blade</h3>
    <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #fff0f5; border-left: 4px solid #9370db;">
        <h4>Weapon of Pure Thought</h4>
        <blockquote>
            With a thought, the blade manifests—a shimmering edge of pure psionic energy, visible only as a faint distortion in the air. It cuts as surely as steel, yet leaves no mark, no wound that healers can see or understand. The mind remembers what the body cannot prove.
        </blockquote>

        <p><strong>Properties of the Psychic Blade:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manifestation:</strong> Summoned and dismissed as a bonus action, requiring no components</li>
            <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Translucent, shimmering blade of mental energy</li>
            <li><strong>Damage Type:</strong> Psychic damage that bypasses physical armor</li>
            <li><strong>No Physical Mark:</strong> Leaves no blood, no wound—only the mental trauma of the strike</li>
            <li><strong>Undetectable:</strong> Many victims don't realize they've been attacked until they collapse</li>
            <li><strong>Perfect for Assassination:</strong> Silent, invisible to most detection, leaves no evidence</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Tactical Advantages:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bypasses metal armor (damage is psychic, not physical)</li>
            <li>Cannot be disarmed (weapon exists only in the mind)</li>
            <li>No blood trail or forensic evidence</li>
            <li>Opponents unfamiliar with psionics have no defense</li>
            <li>Can be used even when physically restrained</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h2>Harper Agent & Undercover Work</h2>

    <div class="info-box" style="background-color: #f5f5dc; border-left: 4px solid #8b4513;">
        <h3>Those Who Harp</h3>
        <p>Tyrael serves <strong>The Harpers</strong>, a secret network of spies, scouts, and saboteurs who work to preserve balance, protect the innocent, and oppose tyranny throughout Faerûn. As a Harper agent, she operates in the shadows that her sister Iawynn illuminates with holy light.</p>

        <h4>Harper Philosophy</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Balance:</strong> No single power should dominate; tyranny must be checked</li>
            <li><strong>Secrecy:</strong> Work from the shadows; recognition is not the goal</li>
            <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Defend the innocent and the powerless from oppression</li>
            <li><strong>Information:</strong> Knowledge is the greatest weapon; gather it, guard it, use it wisely</li>
            <li><strong>Individual Action:</strong> Trust agents to act independently for the greater good</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Tyrael's Harper Role</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Intelligence Gathering:</strong> Infiltration, observation, information extraction</li>
            <li><strong>Assassination:</strong> Eliminating threats too dangerous to confront openly</li>
            <li><strong>Sabotage:</strong> Disrupting enemy operations without revealing Harper involvement</li>
            <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Guarding innocents and allies from unseen dangers</li>
            <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> Working alongside other agents like Magnus Irongrip and Skylark</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Master of Disguise</h3>
    <div class="npc-card">
        <h4>"No One Pays Attention to the Help"</h4>
        <p>Tyrael's preferred covers when operating undercover:</p>

        <h5>The Cook</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cover Story:</strong> Skilled chef looking for work</li>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> Kitchens see everything—servants gossip, nobles confide, documents are left on tables</li>
            <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Tyrael is genuinely an <em>excellent chef</em>, making the cover authentic</li>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Expected to be present during private meals; can add substances to food/drink if needed; kitchens have knives and other tools</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>The Tavern Wench</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cover Story:</strong> Serving girl in need of coin</li>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> Taverns are where secrets are spilled, deals are made, and travelers pass through</li>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Invisible to the drunk and boastful; can overhear conversations; expected to move freely</li>
            <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Service industry workers are underestimated and ignored—perfect for an agent</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The Philosophy:</strong> People talk freely around servants. Guards don't watch the kitchen staff. Nobles ignore the waitress. A star elf who could be recognized is instantly forgotten when dressed in an apron and carrying a tray. Tyrael has learned that the best disguise isn't elaborate—it's being beneath notice.</p>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <h4>The Bond Between Them</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Age Gap:</strong> Tyrael is 80 years older—she helped raise Iawynn</li>
            <li><strong>Complementary Skills:</strong> They cover each other's weaknesses</li>
            <li><strong>War Veterans:</strong> Fought together in the War of the Silver Marches</li>
            <li><strong>Mutual Respect:</strong> Each respects the other's chosen path, even when methods differ</li>
            <li><strong>Shared Purpose:</strong> Both dedicated to protecting the innocent and fighting evil</li>
            <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Absolute faith in each other, even when working apart</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Dynamic:</strong> Tyrael often works to eliminate threats before Iawynn ever knows they existed. When threats are too large or too public, Iawynn confronts them in Selûne's light. Together, they are a formidable pair—one sister clears the shadows, the other stands as a beacon against the darkness.</p>

        <h3>Potential Story Arcs</h3>

        <h4>Arc 1: The Psionic Conspiracy</h4>
        <p>Discovery of other psionic practitioners in the region—some benevolent, some dangerous. Tyrael must decide whether to reveal her abilities or continue working in secret.</p>

        <h4>Arc 2: Harper Leadership</h4>
        <p>Promotion within the Harpers brings greater responsibility and moral complexity. Tyrael must balance organizational loyalty with personal ethics.</p>

        <h4>Arc 3: Sisters in Conflict</h4>

        <h3>Final Notes</h3>
        <p>Tyrael represents the necessary shadow to Iawynn's light. While her sister stands as a beacon of Selûne's grace, Tyrael operates in the spaces between—protecting, observing, and eliminating threats before they reach the light. Her psionic powers and Harper training make her uniquely effective, while her culinary skills provide perfect cover. She is the knife in the dark that allows her sister to remain a sword in the sun.</p>
