# Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide: Wizard Towers, Ancient Ruins, Narfell, and the Demon-Haunted Forests

The demon-scarred lands of northeastern Faerûn where the fallen Narfell Empire's ruins still leak corruption into the Dunwood/Rawlinswood forest. This guide provides everything needed to run campaigns in this region, plus broader coverage of wizard towers and ancient ruins across the Realms.

## The Dunwood revelation: where all threads connect

**Dunwood and Rawlinswood are the same forest** – renamed after 1479 DR to reflect its demon-infested nature. This forest sits atop Dun-Tharos, the ancient capital of the Narfell Empire, where demon-binding wizards once ruled. The site now hosts multiple wizard towers (Clymph Tower, Tower Threespires), ancient Narfell ruins crawling with demons, and desperate druids fighting to contain the corruption. This convergence makes it an ideal campaign setting.

The forest spans 400+ miles across northeastern Faerûn, bordering Damara, Impiltur, and modern Narfell. Dense firs and pines create perpetual twilight, while northern reaches transition to treacherous taiga and muskeg. The climate is brutally harsh – bitter winters, cool mosquito-plagued summers, and year-round gloom beneath the canopy. Three major waterways flow through: River Lench (west to Great Imphras River), Rawlin River (south from Giantspire Mountains), and Forest Blood River (south to Easting Reach).

## Narfell's demon-binding legacy

The Narfell Empire (970 DR to 150 DR) represents one of Faerûn's darkest chapters. Founded by Thargaun Crell, the first Nentyarch, the empire's defining characteristic was **blood-pacts with demon lords** – particularly Orcus – that granted terrible sorcerous powers. Three dynasties ruled from Dun-Tharos: the Crell Dynasty, the Orgolath Dynasty, and finally the half-fiend Darakh Dynasty, where all six Nentyarchs were literally sons of demon lords.

The empire's apocalyptic end came in 160-150 DR during the "Great Conflagration" – a decade-long war with rival Raumathar. As Narfell summoned Eltab, Kostchtchie, and demon hordes, desperate Raumathari priests summoned an avatar of Kossuth that incinerated both armies. Both empires were utterly destroyed, but the demons remained, stalking the lands for centuries. **In 1373 DR, the Rotting Man's failed ritual at Dun-Tharos awakened these ancient demons again**, creating the current crisis.

### Key Narfell locations for adventures

**Dun-Tharos** dominates as the primary adventure site. Built 970 DR over even older dark elf ruins (Narathmault, from 10400 DR), this tree-lined fortress served as imperial capital for 800 years. After the Great Conflagration, druids claimed it in 722 DR, erecting a living tree-fortress called "the Close." When the Rotting Man seized control in 1371 DR, he killed and animated these trees. His death in 1373 DR released the buried demons. Today, petty demon lords and the Fraternity of Tharos demon-cult rule the ruins.

The site offers **miles of underground tunnels** with wooden doors, carved stone faces, and bizarre properties. Key locations include the Barrow of the Queen Abiding (connects to Arches of Xenosi), the Sighing Vault, pictographic trap rooms, and salt-crystal demon chambers. The Close – now a horrifying mass of dead, animated trees – looms over everything. For session planning, Dun-Tharos works for levels 10-20, with outer ruins manageable at lower levels.

**Val-Murthag** (western Great Dale edge) served as Narfell's unholy spiritual center of demon worship. Raumathari battle-magic destroyed the surface, leaving crumbling stone walls, but deep vaults beneath contain trapped demons, undead, stolen Raumathari artifacts, and a ritual to transform mortals into fiends. This makes an excellent mid-level dungeon (7-12) with significant treasure and dangerous lore.

**Citadel of Conjurers** (Dun-Orthass, in Earthspur Mountains, Impiltur) is where Eltab was first summoned in 160 DR. This black stone tower at Moaning Gorge's mouth contains the Hall of the Hidden Throne – a massive "demoncyst" (fragment of the Abyss linked to Faerûn) – and the Adamantine Binding that ties Eltab to the Prime Material Plane. Labyrinthine catacombs hold Narfelli artifacts including the Shiftglass of Orthass. The paladin Sarshel shattered the Crown of Narfell here in 731 DR. A protective spellward and military outpost surround it. This epic-tier location (15-20) offers world-changing stakes.

Other notable sites include **Fortress of the Half-Demon** (near Lake Ashane, built of ice-cold green-vapor stone, currently occupied by hagspawn Losk with thieves), **Fortress Narder** (Forest of Lethyr, poisoning groundwater with buried taint), **Jastaath Castle** (Mount Nar summit, buried in everlasting ice), and **Shandaular** – the destroyed capital of Ashanath, now the "City of Weeping Ghosts" haunted by Nar demonpriest spirits.

### The Crown of Narfell and demon-binding magic

**The Crown of Narfell** stands as the empire's most significant artifact. Forged in 970 DR by Thargaun Crell, this mithral circlet extracted wearers' souls upon death, transforming bodies into crown-wraiths. Powers magnified over 700+ years and 17 Nentyarchs, corrupting the royal court and compelling demon consorting. When paladin Sarshel shattered it in 731 DR, the crown-wraiths escaped and formed the Shadow Crown of Ndulu. The Triad's priests reforged it in 732 DR as a symbol of mercy, truth, and justice – now Impiltur's royal regalia.

Narfell's demon-binding methodology involved opening portals to the Abyss and Nine Hells using only glyphs and wards learned from nearby giants. **Every uncovered Nar fortress contains summoning chambers**. The practice created "demoncysts" – fragments of the Abyss (typically 100+ feet diameter) linked to Faerûn by bindings. These scattered throughout northeast Faerûn contain trapped fiends. The connection persists as long as the Adamantine Binding exists, making its destruction a campaign-worthy goal requiring the legendary sword Hadryllis.

## Wizard towers of the Dunwood and beyond

The Dunwood contains three significant magical towers, all connected to the region's dark history:

**Clymph Tower** (eastern forest) is a ruined walled keep built 500 years ago by demonbinder Clymph. Legend claims he created a permanent gate to the Abyss. The stones glow red with heat, and massive fire crackles from the depths, supposedly trapping dozens or hundreds of demons. A portal connects to Tower Threespires. For sessions, this works as a mid-level (8-14) dungeon with infernal challenges and potential gate-sealing quest.

**Tower Threespires** (eastern forest) features three vine-wrapped stone spires maintained by druids descended from the Nentyarch's guardians. The north tower peak holds a portal to Clymph Tower. Every Feast of the Moon, druids perform a ritual to keep the portal sealed. They're deeply suspicious of strangers. This offers social encounters and ritual-protection scenarios for any level.

**Nighthawk Tower** (eastern edge) is a mighty 100-foot oak with rope-and-wood platforms, home to Hensoi (NG male human Druid 12 of Silvanus), the friendliest druid in Great Dale. Filled with raptors and birds, this provides a safe haven and ally base.

### Iconic wizard towers across Faerûn

For campaigns extending beyond the Dunwood, the Realms offers legendary wizard towers with distinct personalities:

**Blackstaff Tower** (Waterdeep) epitomizes arcane might. Founded 1262 DR by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun (Chosen of Mystra), the black stone spire absorbs light and features completely smooth exterior walls with no windows except the obsidian archway entrance. The ever-changing interior shifts to confuse intruders. **Defenses include anti-teleportation wards, sentient guardians, Shadow Sentinels** (spirits of past Blackstaffs), and reality-warping effects that trap intruders in endless loops or pocket planes. Current Blackstaff Vajra Safahr inherited libraries containing spells from ancient Netheril. The tower itself may be sentient. For sessions, this works for high-level intrigue or as patron base.

**Elminster's Tower** (Shadowdale) contrasts sharply – a modest 3-story fieldstone tower covered in kudzu vines, appearing like an abandoned windmill with lean-tos and shacks. The Sage of Shadowdale's home deceives through simplicity. **Defenses include polite warning runes** ("please" and "thank you"), distance distortion spells, teleportation runes sending intruders to random planes, and an iron golem in the cellar. Every surface inside is covered with papers, books, scrolls, and notes. The tower offers iconic NPC encounters and quest-giving opportunities.

**Host Tower of the Arcane** (Luskan) resembles a massive dead tree on Cutlass Island. Built 354 DR by Netherese arcanist Melathlar, the central spire with four cardinal-oriented "limbs" houses the evil Arcane Brotherhood. Founded by lich Arklem Greeth in 1311 DR, the organization's Archmage Arcane occupies the central spire while four Overwizards control the limbs. **Destroyed in 1376 DR when Greeth broke a staff of the magi**, it was magically rebuilt in 1486 DR. The tower connects to Gauntlgrym via magical roots transporting seawater to cool the primordial Maegera. This offers villain headquarters and high-stakes infiltration scenarios.

**Tower of Twilight** (Neverwinter Wood, small lake island) is Malchor Harpell's emerald green tower with two twisted spires. **Invisible in sunlight**, it appears as light fades. An emerald bridge spans to the island; an extradimensional portal through the wall provides entry. Seven levels house stables, museum, laboratory, kitchen, quarters, study, and meditation chambers. Malchor gifted Drizzt the scimitar "Twinkle" here in 1356 DR. The tower vanished during the 1385 DR Spellplague and reappeared in 1451 DR. Perfect for mysterious ally encounters.

**Candlekeep** isn't a single tower but a fortress-library with dozens of towers forming Faerûn's greatest knowledge repository. Located on a rocky crag overlooking the Sea of Swords, the silhouette resembles "a cake decorated with an overabundance of candles." **Entry requires donating a book worth 1,000+ gp not already in the collection**. The Avowed maintain security through the Gatewarden. Towers store books, house arcane experiments, and contain extradimensional spaces. Abandoned in winter due to cold. Use Candlekeep for research quests, forbidden lore, and high-security archives.

**Myth Drannor's Six Tyryl Towers** and other ruins represent fallen elven wizardry. The famous wizarding school led by Abarat the Alabaster (until his 669 DR disappearance) rumored to offer Netherese insights. After Myth Drannor's 714 DR fall, towers became haunted by wizshades and dweomervores. Notable locations include Abarat's Folly (pure ivory tower with planar gates), the Incanistaeum (world-famous academy disbanded 690 DR), Windsong Tower (Darcassan the diviner's home), Adamant Tower (lich Archimiles' lair with multi-level dungeon), and the Speculum (massive School of Wizards, now beholder or illithid lair). These work for high-level exploration with corrupted magic and dangerous guardians.

### Architectural and defensive features for homebrew towers

Standard wizard tower architecture follows patterns: **3-10 stories tall, cylindrical or conical shape, stone construction enhanced with magic**. Entrances are often hidden, magically sealed, or require specific conditions. Common defensive features include anti-teleportation wards, scrying protection, shifting architecture, dimensional spaces (bigger on inside), automated defenses (golems, animated objects, spell traps), and magical lighting. Vertical transportation uses levitation or teleportation circles.

Typical room layout places reception/storage/guards on ground floor; kitchen/servants' quarters in lower levels; living quarters/guest rooms in middle levels; study/library/laboratory in upper levels; observatory/meditation chamber/powerful magic workspace at top; and vaults/prisons/dangerous experiments in basement. For inspiration, consider unique features like portals to Elemental Plane of Fire for cooking, liquid-form books, gravity reversal, time dilation, aquarium rooms, pocket dimension gardens, clone laboratories, or even gift shops for eccentric wizards.

## Ancient ruins and pre-empire civilizations

The Creator Races dominated Faerûn 35,000-30,000 years ago during the "Days of Thunder," millennia before Narfell or Netheril. Understanding them provides context for the deepest, most alien ruins.

### The five Creator Races and their ruins

**Sarrukh** (reptilian creators, first to rise at 35,000 DR) created yuan-ti, nagas, lizardfolk, and troglodytes. Three major empires dominated: **Okoth** (35,000 DR, conquered most of Faerûn within 100 years), **Mhairshaulk** (34,800 DR, Chultan Peninsula), and **Isstosseffifil** (34,500 DR, present-day Anauroch). These two-formed beings (bipedal humanoid-serpent or full serpentine) with glowing red eyes created the **Ba'etith organization** that forged the **Nether Scrolls** – golden "Skins of the World Serpent" containing immense magical knowledge including mythal creation.

Key sarrukh sites include **Hisari** (ruins with guardian Shristisanti), **Crypt of Hssthak** (houses 2 Nether Scrolls), **Oreme** (scroll creation site), and **Ss'thar'tiss'ssun** (later rebuilt as Najara). These ruins typically contain yuan-ti guardians, trapped sarrukh magic, and transformation chambers. The sarrukh themselves are extremely rare but exceptionally powerful if encountered.

**Batrachi** (amphibious creators, rose 33,500 DR) stretched from Black Sea to Lopango's peaks through empires Kolophoon, Boitumelo, Nadezhda, and Zhoukoudien. These huge frog-like shapeshifters created bullywugs, doppelgangers, kuo-toa, and locathah. **The Hall of Mists** beneath Grandfather Tree in the High Forest houses Nether Scrolls. The empire ended with **the Tearfall** (31,000 DR) when batrachi summoned a meteor to win a war, catastrophically flooding the world. Survivors possibly fled to Limbo and became slaadi. Batrachi ruins lie underwater or deep underground, featuring shapeshifting magic and aquatic guardians.

**Aearee** (avian creators, rose 31,000 DR after Batrachi fall) created aarakocra, kenku, and wyverns. Three empires dominated: **Aearee-Krocaa** (capital Viakoo on Mount Havraquoar), **Aearee-Syran** (capital Phwiukree in Star Mounts), and **Aearee-Quor** (domain of Shara in Orsraun Mountains). Dragons destroyed their rookeries and floating cities, driving survivors west to Maztica. Aearee ruins feature aerial architecture, wind magic, and dragon guardians who claimed the territories.

**Fey (LeShay)** established the Faerie realm 34,000 DR, creating korreds, sprites, and pixies. They ruled harmoniously with minimal material plane impact. Fey ruins blend with nature, featuring portals to Feywild and fey guardians.

### Fallen human empires: Netheril and Imaskar

**Netheril** (3859 DR to 339 DR) represents the pinnacle of human magical achievement and hubris. This "Empire of Magic" discovered Nether Scrolls in 3533 DR, leading to unprecedented arcane advancement. The empire split into High Netheril (floating enclaves) and Low Netheril (ground cities). Archmage Ioulaum raised the first enclave **Xinlenal** in 1690 DR using a mythallar – 54 total flying enclaves were eventually created.

**The Fall came in 339 DR** when archwizard Karsus cast "Karsus's Avatar," attempting to replace the goddess Mystryl. The spell briefly succeeded, then catastrophically failed, killing Mystryl, causing all magic to cease momentarily, and crashing every flying enclave. Most smashed into the ground; a few survived through unique circumstances.

Named enclaves with known fates provide adventure sites: **Thultanthar** (Shade Enclave) survived in Shadowfell, returned 1372 DR, destroyed 1487 DR. **Xinlenal** crashed in Neverwinter Wood (Forest of Hides). **Ythryn** crashed north of Icewind Dale, frozen by Auril into a necropolis. **Sakkors** fell into Sea of Fallen Stars, later refloated by Shadovar. **Karsus** crashed spectacularly, detailed in sourcebooks. The entire Anauroch Desert is former Netheril, now a wasteland created by imprisoned **phaerimm** – ancient cone-shaped, tentacled, magic-draining aberrations.

Netheril ruins offer **epic-level spells** (pre-Mystra's Ban), mythallars, quasi-magical items, ancient spell formulas, and dangerous constructs like tomb tappers (anti-phaerimm golems). Typical encounters include shades, phaerimm, liches, and various undead wizards. The Memory Spire (mobile phaerimm tomb), Crypt of Augathra the Mad, and Buried Realms (Underdark beneath Anauroch) provide specific adventure locations.

**Imaskar** (8350 DR to 2488 DR) ruled as the "Godless Wizard Empire" in the now-Raurin Desert (Desert of Desolation). These artificers enslaved people from other worlds via portals (who became Mulhorand/Unther). Lord Yuvaraj, the last emperor, died fighting Horus in 2488 DR. The battle destroyed the capital **Inupras**.

Survivors founded **Deep Imaskar** in the Underdark (Earthroot) in 2488 DR, which survives today. **High Imaskar** briefly returned 1385-1487 DR on the surface. Major ruin sites include **Solon** (capital of Lower Imaskar), **Raudor** (contains elder brain, one of four Imaskarcana artifact locations), **Bhaluin**, **Grinning Skull Oasis**, and **Fortress of the Old Man**. Imaskari ruins feature shadesteel golems, Imaskarcana artifacts, portal rooms with planar connections, and godless wizard magic. The entire Raurin Desert offers exploration opportunities.

### Adventure hooks for ancient ruins

**Exploration scenarios**: Ancient map to lost Netherese enclave found (requires aerial travel or Underdark route); Nether Scroll fragment quest collecting pieces before villains; yuan-ti temple activating after millennia (sarrukh awakening threat); mythal malfunction causing wild magic and reality distortions; Imaskari artifact recovery before Thayan Red Wizards.

**Faction plots**: Red Wizards seeking ancient magic in Myth Drannor (infiltration and competition); Zhentarim looting Netherese ruins (sabotage or alliance); Harpers preventing dangerous lore escape (moral complexity – some knowledge should stay buried); yuan-ti cults attempting to resurrect sarrukh (prevent apocalyptic return); Shadovar remnants reclaiming Netherese heritage (sympathetic villains or allies against greater threat).

**Dungeon concepts**: Fallen enclave with functional mythallar (reality-warping effects, power source theft); sarrukh laboratory with yuan-ti creation chambers (body horror and transformation); Imaskari vault with portal room (planar travel required, extraplanar allies/enemies); batrachi temple underwater with shapeshifter guardians (identity challenges); dragon tomb in ruined city (massive hoard, ancient wyrm possibly alive).

## Practical session planning: encounters and NPCs

### Encounter design by location and level

**Outer Dunwood (Levels 1-5)**: Normal wildlife (dire wolves, bears), occasional Circle of Leth patrols (neutral unless provoked), bandits, low-level undead (skeletons, zombies from old battlefields), scouts from demon-corrupted areas testing defenses. Social encounters with Nentyar Hunters, green elf rangers, volodni villages. Difficulty: Manageable with clear escape routes.

**Middle Dunwood (Levels 6-12)**: Blightspawned creatures (corrupted by Talona's touch), undead patrols (wights, wraiths, banedead), minor demon scouts (uthraki, hell hounds), corrupted druids (former Talontar Blightlords), phase spiders, dire bears, werebears, fell trolls. Nar ruins with functional magical traps. Encounter green dragons (young adult), white dragons (adult), gray renders. Moral complexity – some corrupted creatures were innocent victims.

**Deep Dunwood/Dun-Tharos (Levels 13-20)**: Demon lords (individual petty lords vying for territory), greater demons (balors, mariliths, nalfeshnees), powerful undead (vampire lords, liches from Narfell), crown-wraiths, night hags, greater barghests, ancient demons from original Conflagration. Social encounters with Fraternity of Tharos cultists (negotiation vs. combat), imprisoned good entities needing rescue. Environmental hazards from demonic corruption (reality warping, abyssal energies). Epic encounters potentially involving aspects of Orcus or Demogorgon.

### Key NPCs and factions

**The Nentyarch** (N male human Druid 17/Hierophant 5/Sorcerer 6 in 3E stats) – Most powerful druid in northeastern Faerûn. Driven from Dun-Tharos to Yeshelmaar in 1371 DR. The ancient Narfell title now belongs to a druid protecting against demon corruption. Personality: Stern, pragmatic, willing to sacrifice individuals for greater good. Not traditionally "heroic" but genuinely fights for natural order. Can serve as quest-giver, ally with conditions, or morally complex authority figure. Relationship with PCs depends on their respect for nature and competence against demons.

**Circle of Leth** operates in three-ring hierarchy: First Ring (5 High Druids advising Nentyarch), Second Ring (9 Druid Masters commanding Nentyar Hunters, searching out threats), Third Ring (initiates and novices). One of Faerûn's most powerful druidic hierarchies, protecting forests from overharvesting for ~650 years. Now stretched thin fighting demon infestation. Desperate for competent aid but suspicious of outsiders potentially making things worse.

**Hensoi** (NG male human Druid 12 of Silvanus, Nighthawk Tower) – Friendliest druid in Great Dale, loves birds and raptors. Potential ally, information source, safe haven, or patron for low-mid level parties. Unlike Circle of Leth's harsh pragmatism, Hensoi embodies nature's gentler aspects. Use for introducing region before darker elements emerge.

**Princess Rheárma Talltree** leads Rawlinswood green elves. Cooperates with Nentyarch but enjoys spreading rumors about druids. Wild elves remember Nar atrocities and can't forgive easily. She's cautious, fierce, protective of her people. Potential ally against demons but distrusts human adventurers initially. Adventure hook: Needs outside help but won't admit it directly.

**Fraternity of Tharos** (post-1480 DR demon-worshiper cult operating from Dun-Tharos ruins) – Modern inheritors of Narfell demon-binding traditions. Not unified – multiple cells worship different demon lords, compete for influence. Some seek power, others genuinely believe demon lords offer salvation. Leader names unspecified in sources, allowing DM creativity. Use for villain variety – some negotiable, some insane, all dangerous.

**Branimern Rythil** – Renegade Red Wizard exploring Val-Murthag, seeking demon-binding secrets. Represents Thay's interest in Narfell magic. Morally complex – scholarly fascination vs. dangerous research. Could be ally (information sharing), neutral (mutual avoidance), or enemy (competing for artifacts). Provides Thayan faction involvement.

**Kryonar** – White dracolich residing on Mount Nar, possibly in Jastaath Castle ruins. Ancient, knowledgeable about Narfell's true history, collects information and magic. High-level encounter (CR 17+) but potentially negotiable. Dragons accumulate knowledge; Kryonar might trade information for interesting secrets or magical items. Ultimate guardian of whatever remains in Jastaath Castle.

### Treasure and rewards appropriate to region

**Low-level (1-5)**: Minor magical items from recent conflicts (potions, scrolls, +1 weapons), information about demon movements (valuable to Circle of Leth), druidic focus items, maps to deeper ruins, Circle of Leth favor tokens, payment in gold from rescued merchants.

**Mid-level (6-12)**: Narfell era magical weapons (cursed or requiring purification), partial demon-binding texts (dangerous knowledge), minor demoncyst locations, +2 weapons and armor, bags of holding from forgotten supply caches, spell scrolls up to 4th level, potions of various types, gems and art objects worth 1,000-5,000 gp, information about Val-Murthag or Fortress Narder, political alliances with factions.

**High-level (13-20)**: Major Narfell artifacts (Crown of Narfell replicas, Shiftglass of Orthass), complete demon-binding rituals, Nether Scroll fragments, +3 weapons and legendary items, demon true names (control over specific demons), mythallar components, keys to sealed vaults, immunity-granting items against demon corruption, forbidden spells from imperial archives, alliances with archfey or celestials interested in sealing demons permanently.

**Non-standard rewards**: Titles from Circle of Leth (Elder status, voice in councils), land grants in cleared areas, volodni village alliances (plant-based magic), green elf recognition (free passage through territories), knowledge of portal network, druidic training, Nentyarch's personal gratitude (calling card for future aid), sanctuary access at Yeshelmaar.

## Sample adventure frameworks

### "The Seals Are Failing" (Levels 5-8)

Minor demons escape near Kront, attacking travelers on Great Road. Circle of Leth sends Second Ring Druid Master to investigate with PC support. Trail leads to small Narfell dungeon with failing demoncyst seal (3-4 sessions to explore). Inside: Nar barbarian descendants trying to understand ancestors' magic but accidentally weakening seals, ambitious Nar Demonbinder NPC seeking to "reclaim heritage," actual trapped demon manipulating everyone.

**Key encounters**: Nar barbarians (possible allies if convinced), animated Narfell guardians (tomb tapper constructs), minor demons (uthraki, hell hounds), demonbinder villain (boss fight), and ethical choice – destroy demoncyst completely (severs Abyssal link but releases trapped demon briefly) or repair seals (temporary solution, requires ongoing maintenance).

**Rewards**: Magical items from Narfell era, Circle of Leth favor, information about larger demoncyst network, captured demonbinder's notes (leads to Val-Murthag or other sites), barbarian alliance.

### "Tower of Binding Flame" (Levels 10-13)

Clymph Tower's eternal flames intensify, threatening to burn entire forest. Tower Threespires druids lost contact with scouts investigating. Nentyarch personally requests PC intervention – diplomatic weight indicates severity. Entering Clymph Tower reveals demonbinder Clymph trapped in temporal stasis, cycling through same day eternally. His "permanent" Abyssal gate is actually sustained by time loop.

**Key encounters**: Fire elementals and demons escaping through widening gate, temporal paradoxes (meeting younger versions of defeated enemies), Clymph himself (tragic figure, not purely evil, made mistakes seeking knowledge), and decision point – breaking temporal loop releases Clymph and fully opens gate (must defeat him and close gate in real-time combat) or stabilize loop (reinforces prison but leaves problem unsolved, potential future escalation).

**Rewards**: Clymph's tower contains extensive demon-binding research (dangerous but valuable), temporal magic items, +2/+3 flame-resistant equipment, druidic gratitude (significant Circle of Leth alliance), and potential redeemed Clymph as advisor NPC if players creative with resolution.

### "Reclaiming Dun-Tharos" (Levels 15-20 campaign arc)

Epic campaign to retake the ancient capital. Requires alliance-building across 5-10 sessions: convince green elves (Princess Rheárma demands proof of competence), secure volodni support (cure corrupted plant-folk), negotiate with Rashemen Witches (provide intel on Abyssal planar connections), win Circle of Leth full commitment (complete dangerous mission proving capability), recruit Impiltur paladins (convince kingdom demon threat extends beyond forest).

**Assault on Dun-Tharos**: Multi-session dungeon crawl through ruined capital. First level: Outer ruins with demon patrols and corrupted treants. Second level: Underground tunnels with pictographic traps, salt-crystal demons, the Lurker in the Middle. Third level: Barrow of the Queen Abiding and connection to Arches of Xenosi (potential reinforcement route or escape path). Fourth level: The Close (dead animated tree-fortress, horror atmosphere). Final level: Sighing Vault containing aspect of Orcus or Demogorgon (CR 23-26 encounter).

**Outcomes**: Successful retaking doesn't "solve" everything – Dun-Tharos reconstruction takes years, demon threat persists elsewhere, Fraternity of Tharos survivors plot revenge, but establishes PC legacy and provides base of operations. Failure results in tactical withdrawal, allied casualties, strengthened demon lords, and need for alternative approaches. Partial success (defeating aspect but not securing full site) creates ongoing campaign arc.

## Campaign themes and atmosphere

The demon-haunted forests embody **consequences of ancient hubris**. Narfell's demon-binding seemed powerful and controlled until it destroyed everything. 1,500 years later, the corruption remains. This creates moral complexity – modern Nar people are victims of ancestors' choices, volodni were innocent before corruption, even some demons are simply prisoners trapped millennia ago.

**Isolation and desperation** permeate the region. Dun-Tharos fell in 1373 DR (recent in campaign terms), meaning Circle of Leth recently lost their seat of power. Druids are desperate, stretched thin, willing to accept risky outside help. This inverts typical fantasy dynamics where powerful organizations send heroes on missions; here, the powerful organization needs saving.

**Nature corrupted** provides visceral horror. Trees animated as undead by Rotting Man, volodni transformed into blightspawned plant-abominations, demons warping the forest itself – these invert natural order Circle of Leth represents. Beauty and peace of outer forest contrasts sharply with nightmare near Dun-Tharos.

**Competing evils** offer strategic complexity. Demons from Narfell, Rotting Man's blight corruption (technically ended but legacy persists), Talontar Blightlords (Talona worshipers), Fraternity of Tharos cultists, opportunistic villains exploiting chaos, and potential Thayan or Zhentarim interference. Players can't fight everyone simultaneously; must prioritize and potentially make temporary alliances.

**Epic fantasy scope** balances intimate horror. While individual sessions feature creeping through demon-haunted ruins, the larger campaign involves titan-sized stakes: sealing demonic corruption affecting entire regions, destroying or preserving artifacts that shaped empires, confronting demon lord aspects, and potentially shattering the Adamantine Binding to permanently free or banish Eltab.
