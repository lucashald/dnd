THE GREAT DALE
RAVAGED BY DISEASE
POISONED WITH TREACHERY
Gameliel woke his thralls. There were preparations
to make, rot to culture, spells to unsheathe. He wouldn't
allow the newest, most important outpost of the Rotting
Man's empire to fall back into the idle hands of idiot dru-
ids. He glanced at the dark shape that still hung impaled
on one of the great stones, smirking.
The blightlord felt the weight of the Keystone's cord
around his neck. With it, Gameliel possessed the power
of the Mucklestones. There was no place the Rotting Man
and his most powerful servants could not penetrate at
whim.
But first, he had to prepare the ambush.
Award-winning game designer Bruce R. Cordell
brings us a tale of faith, prophecy, and destiny
that can only be seen through the eyes of

THE RIESTS
PRELUDE
Decay has a power all its own.
When the healthy and whole softens, crum-
bles, and liquefies, an indefinable essence wafts
away like putrid steam off stagnant beach sand.
Decomposing flesh of what once lived radiates
an essential energy in its dissipation. That power
of dissolution can be siphoned by those with the
proper cruel knowledge, and the appropriate
twisted desire.
The Rotting Man had both.
A crystal vase held a single flower, its petals
the color of bone. The flower had only four petals,
each knife-sharp and strangely heavy. The vase
stood upon a slab of rough cut stone; it was an
altar. There, in the heart of the Close, light pen-
etrated, but not easily. Natural light was stained
and filtered by petrified limbs and leaves of
ancient trees whose hearts were pure rot.

--- Page 10 ---
A hand extended from the darkness toward the flower.
The fingers, only a little less thin than the flower's stem,
stroked a petal. The entire bloom turned black with decay
in seconds, and fell, stinking, to the altar-top. Somewhere
in the world, a servant died. Such was the power of the
Rotting Man.
The Rotting Man was an artist of putrescence. For
light, he had no use, unless he could squander its prom-
ise, turning light to malaise. In music, he preferred the
decrescendo, always. Promotion was a rare event in the
Rotting Man's organization, though the Blightlords,
his foul lieutenants, did achieve their position through
applied deceit.
The hand returned to the darkness, shaking just
slightly. He was always in pain. Such was the price he
paid for Talona's gifts.
A tangle of twisted thought sparked across the pits
of his hungry mind. He sensed it then. It was coming. A
prayer would soon be answered, the fulfillment of which
would spell his end. Soon. Any moment...
A ray of light fell secretly into the world, shining from
a place so far beyond the sphere of the world that miles
could not be used as a measure of distance. The light was
a shaft of burning hope, let down to banish what shadows
it could. The light was so fierce that it could scour evil
with its mere presence. It sought the Rotting Man.
He laughed with rare pleasure.
The Rotting Man was ready. To him, the light's arrival
was not secret. In fact, he anticipated it.
He recalled the years during which he had bred the
perfect vessel to contain that light. Spilled blood, the trace
of failed enterprise, and the mournful cries of dying
prisoners shorn of freedom and dignity, all these he had
incorporated into his living prison. Such a wonder of gro-
tesquerie. Oh yes, the Rotting Man was more than ready;
he was primed.
Whence came the light, he cared not. Containing it
2. THE PRIESTS

--- Page 11 ---
was all that mattered. Oh, the light was so optimistic,
so imbued with good intentions, so ready to be corrupted
by the Rotting Man. The sentient light was oblivious of
danger when it arrowed down at him from heaven.
The golden ray was gulped down by the Rotting Man's
living vessel in a single instant. Absorbed, but for a tiny
glint that escaped his notice. A flicker of hope, shorn of
the flush of full strength, fell to earth unmarked and
enfeebled. Too enervated to retain knowledge even of its
own origin, the remnant was accepted into the mortal
world in a guise not intended.
The Rotting Man failed to realize that he had not cap-
tured the light in its entirety.
But eventually he began to suspect.

Autumn, 1368 DR
Ash."
Hemish nearly dropped the child. From her
lips the word issued, as plain as day. He took
a deep breath, and instead of dropping her, he
stroked her baby-brown hair. He continued along
the road away from the small village, shaking his
head. It was not the first time she had spoken.
Hemish was a man of simple means, a keeper
of cattle. He had seen small magic, wonders, and
the flashy spells of hedge wizards. He'd even once
visited the city of Two Stars, and there witnessed
a duel between feuding sorcerers, but a baby that
could speak? Never had he heard of such a thing,
but in his hands he held just such a wonder,
though in truth, the only word she ever said was
'ash.' Not knowing whence she came, Hemish had
taken to calling her the name that she repeated
at odd intervals.

--- Page 13 ---
When he found her, she lay silent on a bed of emerald
moss that grew up around her like a tiny cushion. She
lay on her back, reaching up with her baby fingers as
if attempting to touch the overhanging forest canopy.
Appalled to see a child exposed to the elements, he
scooped her up and brought her back to his home in the
village straightaway. It was only later that she began
to speak.
No local farmer or forest hunter had since appeared
in town to lament a lost child. There was no claim at all
upon her, save his own, and he was uncertain that he
wanted to press it. He had decided to seek once again the
glade where she'd first come into his life. Perhaps he could
discover clues of her origin that he'd earlier missed.
He cradled the girl in his arms protectively, despite
his unease. Tree branches waved idly in the late evening
breeze, stirring up the scents of pine, loam, and forgotten
days of sunshine. The faint smell of the child, babyish and
powdery, put Hemish in mind of his own daughter, before
she was grown and married away.
Soon enough he arrived in the glade where he'd found
the child. All was as he remembered, though the season
had advanced, and seedlings and other forest growth
were failing with the year. He scuffed around with his
boots, looking to kick up any item or other telltale clue
hidden beneath the layer of pine needles. When he turned
up nothing, he moved to the base of the sapling where he'd
found her.
His brows furrowed. The luxuriously soft bed of moss
where he'd found her three tendays past was decidedly
dead. What's more, it seemed afflicted with some brackish
rot, which had eaten away at the heart of the bed before
finally killing it. The rot had spread to the sapling, which
drooped lifeless over the blackened moss bed. All in all, a
nasty blight.
After a search of several minutes, Hemish admitted
defeat. He could find nothing-he chalked the blight up
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 5

--- Page 14 ---
to coincidence. He sighed, chucked the baby on the chin,
and made for town.
"Looks like it's going to be you and me after all, tyke,"
said Hemish, as he looked down into the face of the
child.
The baby stared back with eyes the color of a cloudless
sky. Guileless and pure they seemed, and Hemish felt his
urge to protect the girl grow stronger.
It was a journey of less than an hour back to the vil-
lage. In all that time, the child refrained from fussing or
crying. Hemish headed straight down the main way. He
turned a corner and spied Mausa. Before he could make
a break for it, her gaze locked on him. She stood in the
middle of the road, leading a nag with a bedraggled mane.
He pushed on, accepting the inevitable. Mausa regarded
him with a cruel turn of her lip as he moved closer.
At first, she was content to merely skewer him with
her knowing gaze. Hemish cursed his weakness in ask-
ing the woman's advice on the child. How could he have
guessed she was so superstitious and hateful?
He hurried on, making as if to pass her. He attempted
to fix an expression of defiance on his own features.
As he pulled up even with Mausa, she murmured, "She
still talking?"
Hemish paused and sighed, "Yes. Only the one word,
though."
As if to demonstrate to Mausa, the baby in Hemish's
arms said, "Ash."
As she did so, one of her infant hands reached toward
the horse Mausa led.
"What's she want?" scowled the woman.
Hemish moved a step closer to the bedraggled animal.
Mausa was not a particularly kind master, and the draft
steed was obviously sick. If Ash wanted to feel the horse's
mane, he saw no harm in it.
As the child's hands combed through the equine's
tangled mane, a brilliant blue spark jumped between
6

her fingers and horse. The horse raised its head suddenly,
neighing! Its clouded eyes cleared then sparked with vital-
ity. The matted hair in its mane smoothed. The creature
nearly danced, as if restraining itself from rearing.
"By all the gods of hearth and home," Hemish mum-
bled, "what happened?"
He knew what had happened. The girl had the hands
of a healer.
"Ash," she crooned in his arms.
Mausa's expression, too, changed. Scorn made way for
fear. The woman pulled her horse quickly away.

CHAPTER 2
Spring, 1373 DR
The air was too warm for Marrec.
The link chain of his armor hung heavily
on the padding he wore between the silver mail
and his skin, causing sweat to bead and run. He
removed a gauntlet, stuffed it into his belt, and
mopped his brow. He felt the old scars beneath
his fingers, scars hidden by his hairline. He
hardly gave them a thought. After a lifetime of
repressing those memories, recollections of his
past rarely caught him off guard.
Marrec looked over at his companion who
walked with him down the tree-lined road. He
felt a little envious of Gunggari, who didn't wear
much of anything, save for a collection of strange
tattoos, thick-soled leather shoes, and a breech-
clout. Earlier, the noon-day sun's glare had been
tempered by a breeze, but the road had passed
into a forested acreage. The trees stood tall on

--- Page 17 ---
either side but failed to reach their branches across the
gap of the road. The sun beat down through the gap, but
the trees blocked the cooling breeze.
"Hot enough for you, Gunny?" Marrec asked his friend.
Gunggari shrugged and smiled. "Good weather for
walking."
"Maybe, if you're not wearing fifty pounds of armor,"
snorted Marrec.
Gunggari Ulmarra was a strange one. Though he'd
traveled with the southerner for over two years, Marrec
was still unused to the man's disdain for the trappings
of civilization, especially clothing. All Gunggari cared
about was the long, stout wooden tube he carried, which
he was currently using as a walking staff. Marrec had
seen Gunggari use the thing as a warclub and a musical
instrument with equal facility. Colorful designs dotted
the tube's exterior. It was called a dizheri and was an
object peculiar to Gunggari's home. Gunggari didn't
talk much about the nation of his origin, other than to
say he hailed from the far south "beyond the girdle of
the world" in a place called Osse. There Gunggari was
known as a tattooed soldier. Marrec wasn't sure if the
name was a designation or a title, as in The Tattooed
Soldier. The Oslander had never deigned to explain, and
Marrec didn't push him on the topic, especially because
so much time had passed since they took up traveling
together.
"Ask Lurue a boon-perhaps a cooling breeze?" joked
Gunggari.
Lurue was Marrec's patron goddess, to whom he owed
fealty and from which he drew much of his strength. Be-
cause he was already annoyed by the heat, Marrec chose
to interpret the statement seriously.
"Gunny, you know I can't waste her time for personal
indulgences. Besides, it's getting worse." He admitted the
last almost under his breath.
He sighed. Contact with his patron goddess, Lurue

the Unicorn Queen, was growing ever more difficult.
Just to see if he could, he mentally probed for the con-
nection that used to form as easily as shafts of sunlight
find the forest floor...
Marrec nearly stumbled for lack of concentrating on
the uneven path.
"Watch your step," grunted Gunggari. "The stones
will catch your feet if you let them." The Oslander point-
ed ahead, where the path ascended quickly to the crown of
a hill. The west flank of the hill was hidden in crowding
pines and firs that cast long shadows over the rocky way.
Gunggari gave him a sidelong glance, "Are you tired?
We could stop for a rest, if you like, or-is something else
bothering you?"
Marrec sighted. "Lurue's silences have grown, Gunny.
Last night, I almost felt as if she were absent completely.
When it came time for my nightly prayer of renewal..."
"What?"
"Nothing."
"That ever happened before?" quizzed Gunggari.
"No, at least not so completely. My connection has been
deteriorating these last few years, like I said before, but
this is the worst it's been."
"And... your vision?"
The Oslander referred to a dreamlike visitation Marrec
had received several months earlier.
Gunggari continued, "Are we close enough that you
can go without guidance?"
Marrec answered, "We're very close. I know that
much."
The Oslander offered, "Perhaps her attention is being
drawn elsewhere."
Maybe so. Where before the cleric had felt the presence
of Lurue in every prayer, observance, and divine ritual,
the presence had become uncertain, spotty, and some-
times altogether absent. Marrec shrugged. The cleric had
met other servants of the Unicorn Queen, and while most
10. THE PRIESTS

--- Page 19 ---
seemed unaffected, a few reported feeling similarly to
Marrec. Those worst afflicted could no longer trust that
the divine spells they cast in Lurue's name would return
anew each day. Marrec suffered the same humiliation.
"Gunny, the vision was real. I didn't dream it, if that's
what you're getting at."
The tattooed soldier raised both hands in a concilia-
tory gesture, said "I know, the 'Child of Light in Hemish's
charge." "My feet grow weary-I hope we find this Hemish
in Fullpoint."
A vision had come to Marrec. From within the bril-
liance of a crescent moon, the silhouette of a unicorn
spoke to him. The enchanting voice instructed him to
seek the Child of Light and the child's guardian, Hemish.
The voice indicated that finding the child would help
both Marrec and one other in similar straits.
"I hope so, too," Marrec answered his friend.
Gunggari continued, "Even if it comes to nothing, I
enjoyed our trip across the Sea of Fallen Stars. It nearly
rivaled my trip across the Great Sea. I trust your last
divination, the most recent one."
Marrec realized the Oslander was not needling him.
Gunggari merely said what was on his mind, nothing
more or less. As his friend said, his last pure divinatory
contact with neglectful Larue pointed unerringly to the
village of Fullpoint. Fullpoint lay several leagues west
and somewhat south of a large city called Two Stars.
They'd traveled along the trade road known as the Golden
Way since debarking from their ship in Telflamm. They
had turned off southeast before reaching Two Stars, to
Gunggari's disappointment. The visitors had been told
that Two Stars was a city where Trade was coddled as if
a favorite son, and nothing was forbidden.
Marrec said, "The closer we come to finding Hemish,
and hopefully this mysterious Child of Light, the spot-
tier becomes my contact. I doubt that Lurue does not
want me to answer this riddle, and I don't think she is
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 11

--- Page 20 ---
becoming neglectful... I think that she is somehow be-
ing prevented from making contact..."
Marrec stopped speaking and cocked his head.
"Did you hear that?"
Faint cries and the ring of metal on metal echoed from
over the hill. A thick stream of smoke tumbled up from
behind the rise ahead. Something was burning, and it
didn't look like a chimney.
"Let's go!" shouted Marrec.
Racing to the top of the hill, Marrec and Gunggari
saw the source of the cries and smoke: a small village in
the forest clearing was under attack. Creatures swarmed
around the buildings, smiting villagers and setting fire
to buildings. At first glance, the attackers seemed to be
small animate trees.
"By the Ancestor," muttered Gunggari. The Oslander
swept up his walking staff, ready for trouble, brandish-
ing it like the warclub it actually was. He waited for
Marrec's cue.
Marrec took a second to take stock.
The attacking creatures were not trees after all. In
fact, they somewhat resembled humans, though their
skin was the deep olive-green of a pine needle. Their
flesh was woody and tough, but they all sported oozing
sores from which a putrid slime seeped, as if they were
slowly rotting. Their hair grew out in long, thick locks
scaled like the bark of a young tree. Their eyes gleamed
black with hatred. The creatures seemed somewhat fa-
miliar to Marrec, something he'd learned about in his
training: they were similar to creatures called volodnis,
but he didn't think true volodnis had such a sense of rot
or decay about them as these oozing creatures had, but
he was no expert.
Buildings continued to burn. Several humans and
attackers lay wounded or dead in the village street. If
the creatures had some goal, it wasn't apparent, unless
it was simple mayhem.

THE PRIESTS

--- Page 21 ---
A sickening realization occurred to Marrec. He said,
"Gunggari... I think this is the village of Fullpoint!"
With that, he leaped down the other side of the hill,
pulling his spear from where he kept it strapped to his
back. Called Justlance, the spear tip was fashioned of
gleaming adamantine in the shape of a regal unicorn
horn. It was possessed of a potent enchantment that
Marrec's past enemies had learned to fear, if they sur-
vived their initial meeting.
Gunggari followed Marrec but first raised one end of
the long warclub to his lips. He blew down the hollow tube
carved through the bole. A noise blazed forth. The sound,
like a huge animal roaring or screaming-Marrec could
never be sure-froze the volodnis and villagers alike with
its hackle-raising ululation.
Marrec used the moment of distraction to run right
up to one of the startled outlying attackers. The blighted
thing had been in the middle of throttling a young farm-
er. Barely pausing in his dash toward the center of town,
the unicorn warrior swept the tip of his spear across the
volodni's neck. With a gurgling cry of pain, the creature
flopped to the ground, oozing a combination of clear sap
and black rot. Its former captive jumped back, gasping for
breath, but Marrec was already running toward a larger
concentration of attackers.
Gunggari was right on Marrec's heels. The tattooed
soldier was far quicker than Marrec, especially without
armor weighing him down, which proved lucky. A blighted
volodni Marrec hadn't noticed jumped him from behind.
Gunggari's warclub crunched against the creature's head,
and the beast bleated and fell away from Marrec before
it could do much more than scratch at his armor. Marrec
darted a glance backward and saw that Gunggari had
engaged the creature. He knew it'd take but seconds for
Gunggari to dispatch an average foe. For all Marrec's
physical prowess, he knew that the tattooed soldier was
his better in straight-up combat, but not by much.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 13

--- Page 22 ---
The other attackers began to respond to Marree and
Gunggari's advance. Marrec could hear them calling to
one another, warning of the counterattack. Their speech
had the sound of pine-needles rubbing together in a
strong wind. Ahead, the creatures began to mass. Other
outlying attackers began to fade back into the trees.
It was difficult to estimate how many rot fiends had to
be dealt with. Marrec spied more of the creatures running
off into the trees that lined the town to the northwest.
Good, the fewer he had to deal with the better. Unfor-
tunately, a few braver creatures ahead were obviously
prepared to receive their charge. Better take it slow.
"How many, do you think?" asked Marrec, pausing his
headlong rush.
"More than ten, less than twenty," responded Gung-
gari, as he came up alongside.
"Like those odds?"
"I've faced worse."
"Then let's show these failed trees their mistake," ex-
claimed Marrec. "I'll take the right flank. You got left?"
Gunggari nodded.
They charged. Marrec peeled off to the right, Gung-
gari left. The volodnis' force split roughly down the
middle, but those making up Marrec's half failed to turn
quickly enough to defend against his initial spear thrust.
The spiral spear-head began to glow white, a light akin to
the moon's glow, though it wasn't too distinct in day's full
light. The first one went down with a spear thrust to the
eye. Black rot spewed but failed to adhere to Justlance,
just one of the advantages of a weapon blessed by a deity.
Two other creatures rushed forward where their
brother had fallen. One attempted to duck under the
shaft while the other offered a distraction. Marrec had
been a spear fighter long enough to know that the first
rule of the spear is to never allow an enemy to get under
the range of the shaft. He backed up a step and choked up
his grip. A slash across the creature's exposed stomach
14. THE PRIESTS

--- Page 23 ---
ended its days. The other used that second to launch itself,
but Marrec knew what he was doing. Without changing
his grip, he swung the butt-end of the shaft around in a
violent figure eight, catching the monster on the temple.
The beast was stunned just long enough for another
thrust. Another rot fiend down.
Something banged against his left shoulder hard
enough to spin him half around. Another blighted
volodni, a thick cudgel in hand, had appeared from the
rear, landing a solid blow. Pain arced from his shoulder
a second later, but it wasn't fast enough to stop him from
downing the author of his discomfort with an expert
thrust of Justlance.
Only four more were facing in his direction. He'd
thinned them enough to tell that much. Behind them, a
furious churning of limbs, clubs, and shouts showed that
the tattooed soldier was still on his feet. Marrec had ex-
pected nothing less, but it wasn't the time to get cocky.
The villagers who'd borne the brunt of the attack
were taking advantage of Marrec and Gunggari's advent
to pull back from the conflict. Some had pails and were
shouting about the fire. Good. If they were quick enough,
only a few outbuildings would burn.
"Marrec!"
The unicorn warrior's gaze snapped back to the
fight. Apparently their foes had decided that splitting
themselves between Marrec and Gunggari was a poor
choice. They'd rectified it by concentrating all their at-
tacks on Gunggari. The Oslander was pressed up against
the wooden palisade, keeping his attackers at bay with
crushing swings of his dizheri. Even as he watched,
Gunggari batted one of the creatures back so hard that
it actually flew several feet through the air before tum-
bling into a dead, oozing heap. The smell of putrid rot
intensified. Another scored a hit with its cudgel, causing
the Oslander to stumble.
Time to bring to bear another facet of Lurue's power.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 15

--- Page 24 ---
While he reveled in his martial skill, the divine power
Lurue granted her servants was just as potent, or it had
been, before the change. These days, each spell was hard
won, and Marrec used them sparingly. Each one he used
was a precious gift, that seemingly could no longer be
replaced.
Taking one hand from Justlance's shaft, he began to
inscribe a Sign of Capitulation in the air with one finger,
drawing lines of burning fire with quick strokes. Before
he could properly finish, a volodni menacing Gunggari
glanced back, squealed, and tried to stick a sword in
Marrec's belly.
Marrec had to abandon the spell before finishing the
air rune.
"Curse you!" exclaimed Marrec, fumbling backward.
That spell was hard won, and he wondered if he would be
able to renew it or another of its potency with things be-
ing what they were. To see the spell wasted without effect
made the unicorn warrior see red. "Rot take you!"
The blighted volodni followed up on its success by
pressing its attacks with a series of wild swings, some of
which landed. None pierced Marrec's silver mail, but each
would leave a painful bruise.
"Think you've got me?" Marrec asked his attacker.
Taking up Justlance in both hands, he knocked aside his
attacker's blade, then completed the motion by driving
the shaft a foot into the creature's breast. "Turns out,
you're wrong."
In the meantime, Gunggari had eradicated a few more
attackers. As Marrec moved in once more to help the Os-
lander, the remaining creatures broke off and fled toward
the trees. Marrec launched his spear at the hindmost rot
fiend. The shaft arrowed through the air and struck a
volodni's retreating form at a distance of thirty feet.
The force of the cast knocked the creature to the ground,
pinning the beast where it lay. The volodni moved no
more, though it commenced leaking a tainted fluid.
16 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 25 ---
"You like risks," commented Gunggari, as the Os-
lander began to stoically clean the sides of his musical
instrument-cum-warclub. "What if your throw had
merely lodged in the rotting one? He could have retreated
with your weapon."
"The shot was clear; I knew I wouldn't miss. Besides,
perhaps, even after all this time, you don't know all
Justlance's abilities."
Gunggari raised one eyebrow. Marrec just smiled
without elaborating. He was naturally lighthearted
and preferred to focus on the positive, though internally
he still cursed the loss of the Sign of Capitulation. He
quickly paced the distance to where his spear still stood
quivering in the form of the blighted volodni. The stink
was unpleasant. Pulling the shaft free released an even
stronger whiff of corruption which pushed Marrec back.
"Phew! These things aren't undead, but they are al-
most as rot-infested as an animated corpse."
"If not undead, then what? I assumed they were the
work of necromancy," called Gunggari from where he
stood, still cleaning his dizheri. Because it was his sole
possession, the tattooed solider was never lax in the
instrument's care.
"Don't know. Something bad, though," Lurue's cleric
offered, grinning at his own understatement.
A few villagers, having saved what buildings they
could from the fire, eyed Gunggari. It was obvious they
didn't quite know what to make of the southerner. The Os-
lander pretended not to notice the looks as he finalized the
process of returning the dizheri to an unblemished state.
Marrec walked toward two who seemed to have led
the fire-extinguishing initiative, an older man and a
stern, dark haired woman. As he walked up, the woman
eyed him.
She said, "You have the thanks of Fullpoint, but if
you're looking for a reward, I'm afraid the town's trea-
sury was used earlier this spring to buy seed."

Marrec shook his head, "Nope. It was a deed done for
pure purposes, and with the blessing of Lurue, the queen of
goodly peoples and beasts everywhere. My name is Marrec,
and I am Lurue's servant. My friend's name is Gunggari
Ulmarra, and he is a traveler from far lands but a good
soul."
"I'm Tansia; this is Korven," the woman said, pointing
to the older man. "You have our thanks. Though we can't
pay you in coin, we can put you up and feed you and your
companion for as long as you wish to stay in Fullpoint."
"Very kind, Tansia, but perhaps you can answer me a
question: I seek one named Hemish, Hemish of Fullpoint.
Do you know this man?" Hope pitched Marrec's voice
slightly higher than his normally smooth baritone.
The woman nodded, looking bemused, "Hemish? Of
course. He keeps cattle. He lives just east of here on the
town's edge. I can take you there."
"Please, lead on."
As they walked, leading a procession of the curious,
Tansia asked, "Pardon my curiosity, Marrec, but what
brings you to Fullpoint after Hemish? He is a simple
man, and he and his daughter keep pretty much to
themselves."
Marrec said simply, "He was revealed to me in a vision."
Tansia nodded uncertainly but said nothing more. In
short order, she led him up to a home little different than
many of the other village buildings. It, too, showed signs
of the recent conflict. Marrec decided he didn't like the
look of the bashed and ruined door, which hung off its
hinges. He rushed up the two steps and looked inside. He
had Justlance ready in case of lingering rot fiends.
An older man lay on the floor, bleeding, but alive, and
conscious. His wild eyes met Marrec's. His mouth moved,
as he tried to get something out.
Marrec kneeled to tend the fallen man. "If you're
Hemish, I've come a long way seeking you. I'll heal your
wounds, don't worry."

Still the man, his white hair in disarray and eyes wild,
tried to speak.
"What is it? What are you trying to tell me?" wondered
Marrec.
Finally, Hemish spoke.
"They've taken her!"

THE
RIESTS
CHAPTER 3
Hemish's pronouncement was unlikely to bode
anything but poorly for Marrec's quest, but first
things first. Marrec probed the man's wounds with
an experienced hand. The worst was a head wound.
The cleric would be able to dress the other gashes
and scrapes with gauze and salve he kept for mun-
dane hurts, but the head wound would turn ugly if
left untended by anything less than divine cleans-
ing. Marrec sighed. His resolution to conserve his
divine spells in case he completely lost contact
with Lurue was being tested. There was Hemish,
whom he had sought on the goddess' inspiration.
He was there because of a divine vision.
He laid a hand upon the fallen man's brow
and whispered the words of power given him.
The head wound ceased seeping blood as the
puncture closed over as if it had never been. As
the pain faded, Hemish blinked in surprise, but

--- Page 29 ---
his mouth began to work, as if newfound health was the
fuel he needed to launch into a yelling fit.
Marrec cut off Hemish before he could begin, "There.
The pain should fade," said Marrec.
He helped the man to his feet. Hemish grew somewhat
less wild about the eyes but remained quite agitated.
The man finally managed to yell, "Did you see her? My
daughter? One of those tree men ran off with Ash!"
Daughter? Apprehension sent goose bumps stippling
down Marrec's arms. Was this missing girl the Child of
Light, stolen from him just as he was about to find her?
Hemish made as if to rush outside, but a pain more
spiritual than physical seemed to unsteady the man. He
began to pitch forward as if in a faint. Marrec reached out
a hand to steady him.
"Easy. Rest a moment. We'll get her back," promised
Marrec, as he righted a chair and helped Hemish to the
seat. "Wait here."
Marrec ducked his head out the door. He located the
tattooed soldier who waited outside, who was fending off
the thanks of grateful villagers.
"Gunggari-there's been a kidnapping-a child was
taken from Hemish. I think... it might be the child we're
seeking, but I don't know for certain. I need to speak
further with this man. Can you get a bead on the kidnap-
pers, quick?"
The Oslander nodded. Without a word he traced a path
of footprints from the door of the home, slinking toward
the trees where the volodnis had retreated, stepping
quietly but moving with some speed. Experience with his
friend's abilities told Marrec that Gunggari could track
most anything, but he would wait for Marrec's help before
launching any sort of counterattack or rescue. Marrec
ducked back into the house.
The older man looked into Marrec's eyes and said,
"Thank you. Why are you helping me? I don't even know
you. My name is Hemish."
BRUKE R. CORDELL • 21

--- Page 30 ---
"Yes, I know. I'm Marrec, but that's not important
right now. I have a pressing question for you, one I have
traveled leagues to ask." Marrec paused for a breath.
"Hemish, have you ever seen or heard of somebody or
something called the 'Child of Light?'"
Thought creased Hemish's brow. He said, "Well, can't
say that I have. Has it got anything to do with Ash?"
Intuition tickled Marrec, growing stronger. It was ex-
actly the sort of feeling he had learned to trust as subtle
guidance from the higher world. Marrec said, "Hemish, I
believe that your daughter, Ash, is the Child of Light I seek,
the child whom I've been seeking these long months."
Hemish looked at Marrec, nonplussed, and said, "Why?
What's this business with 'light' and seeking? Ash hasn't
done anything. She's normal, if a little slow in the head."
Marrec laid a hand on the man's shoulder and replied,
"I assure you, I come with no sinister intent, exactly the
opposite. The Child of Light is important to the goddess
Lurue, also called the Wild Mother and Healing Hand. I
am her servant, and on her behalf, I've sought the Child of
Light. If Ash and the Child of Light are one and the same,
this can only be a joyous occasion."
"Joyous-what are you talking about? She's been kid-
napped, I told you."
"I've never known Gunggari to fail. He'll find her.
Meantime, I ask you, please tell me more of your daugh-
ter, Ash."
Hemish continued to think, looking up at Marrec, then
fingering the wound Marrec had healed. It didn't take
him long to reach a decision. More calmly than before,
he said, "It doesn't surprise me that someone has finally
come asking about her, actually. She is different, despite
what I just said. She is special. I count myself the luckiest
man alive that it was I who found her lying so helpless in
the trees almost five years now gone past."
Marrec's pulse raised in tempo, "She's not your natural
born child?"
22 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 31 ---
"No. She's a foundling, but just as precious despite
that."
A foundling... Marrec, too, had been raised by those
who were not his real parents, he, too, having being found
out alone in the elements by kindly people. Could there be
some sort of connection? Marrec's fingers brushed at the
scars hidden by his hairline, wondering.
"Does she... does she have a way about her eyes... or
something not quite right about her hair?" asked Marrec,
with a tentative note in his voice.
"Uhm, no. The strange thing is, she can speak. Well,
speak enough to say a single word, even from the day I
found her. 'Ash' is the word she says, and it's what I call her.
That, and..." Hemish paused, gauging Marrec's reaction.
"That, and her touch is magic. If you've taken a hurt or are
feeling poorly, Ash's touch can grant you relief."
The healer's hand. Nothing like his own "condition,"
then. Marrec sighed. Still, if she was the Child of Light
and somehow connected with the Unicorn Queen, her
healing touch wasn't an ability completely unexpected.
"A healer. Truly, a gift from Lurue."
Hemish said, "She's my Ash, and she's been taken by
those things. If she's somehow tied up with you and your
god, it's funny that you show up just now, just as she's
taken away from me. Maybe you drew those creatures
here. What if you're to blame?" His voice cracked from
strain and a sudden anger.
Marrec banished thoughts of his own young memories.
First things first. The Child of Light was in immediate
danger.
"Hemish, I'm going to find her. I'm going to save her
from those creatures that took her from you, and I'm
going to discover just what her connection is to Lurue
and the goddess' growing silence. Right now, I value her
safety above that of all others. You'll know soon enough
if I succeed."
The unicorn warrior strode from the house. He'd
BRUCE R. CORDELL
.
23

--- Page 32 ---
spent enough time gathering information-more could be
learned later when he'd secured the child's safety. Villag-
ers were still gathered outside, talking about the events
of the day. They quieted when Marrec exited Hemish's
home. He waved to them as he quickly moved to the edge
of the trees where Gunggari had darted into the woods.
Marree called back over his shoulder, "I'm going to
find Hemish's girl," for the benefit of queries he heard
in his wake.
Within the shade of the first few trees, Marrec smiled.
He found what he'd hoped-a tiny cairn of hastily as-
sembled pebbles. Gunggari had left the marker indicating
the direction he'd taken in tracking the blighted volodnis.
That was a technique they'd used before. Marrec couldn't go
nearly as quietly as the Oslander, but following markers, he
could bring up the rear quickly enough.
Marrec strode confidently into the trees on the trail
of Gunggari, fleeing volodnis, and he hoped, the Child
of Light. How odd that she should be a foundling, just as
Marrec had been.
Tired and alone, the child waved his arms ineffectu-
ally and tried to crawl into the center of the empty road.
He didn't know why he had been abandoned; he was too
young to remember much. He ceased crying hours earlier.
He was too tired and too hungry to cry. All that was left
was dreary persistence.
When Harmon the cobbler found the infant, the child
was nearly dead of exposure. Staring up at the newcomer
who had intruded on his field of view, the child made a
small sound, trying to give voice to his day of loneliness
and cold. Only a whimper escaped the infant's lips.
Harmon was a good man and did the right thing. The
cobbler brought the baby boy back into town. Harmon
and his wife Celia nursed the young boy back to health
24 ⚫ THE PRIESTS

--- Page 33 ---
and began to ask around as to the child's identity, but it
was soon clear that no one would claim the lost boy. Ap-
parently, he was an orphan.
Harmon named the boy Marrec and brought the
foundling into his family. Already the father of six other
children, the cobbler and his wife didn't make the decision
lightly. Marrec was another mouth to feed and another
responsibility for Harmon and Celia, but soon enough
Marrec came to regard the kind man and his smiling
wife as his real parents. Being only a year and a half old,
unable to recall his past, where he had come from, or even
how he had been abandoned in the wilderness, Marrec
made that internal transition automatically.
Marrec grew into a healthy, inquisitive boy. Though
raised as a brother, his older siblings always treated him
a little differently, keeping him at something of a dis-
tance. That was fine with Marrec. He delighted mostly
in the arts of sword, spear, and bow, though he also found
solace in the wild. Marrec was particularly fond of the
deer, the coyotes, and other animals of hill and glen. He
kept many pets of that sort as he grew older, though his
parents frowned on anything more dangerous than a
hare. His adopted brothers and sisters cared more for
the arts of commerce, specifically cobbling, except for
his step-brother Emmon. Emmon shared Marrec's pas-
sion for the wild, though he didn't share Marrec's facility
with swords, staves, and other implements of the warrior.
Emmon often accompanied Marrec on his treks out of
town into the edges of the badlands. Growing up, Emmon
was Marrec's closest friend.
Once Marrec and Emmon stayed out overnight on a
dare. They set out, pockets bulging with hard rolls. Mar-
rec had even thought to bring a waterskin filled from the
well. Had the rain stayed away, their short overnight trip
would have gone unremembered, but the rain did come
that night, and with it a drop in temperature so extreme
that the two boys were forced to seek shelter. They found
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 25
•

--- Page 34 ---
a small cave, as had a mountain bear who was not eager
to share.
The bear swiped Emmon across the shoulder, adding
a flow of blood to the rain's deluge. The attack's bru-
tality tumbled Marrec back out into the rain with his
step-brother. Emmon lay moaning off to the side, while
Marrec lay sprawled not more than a few feet from the
cave. His hands scrabbled across the rain-slick forest
floor. As the bear emerged from the cave-mouth to finish
off the two intruders, one of Marrec's hands closed about a
thick wooden shaft. Knowledge flashed into his head-he
knew what he had to do to survive the next two seconds.
As the bear lunged, he pulled the broken tree branch up,
aiming the pointed end at the descending bear, allowing
the other end to remain butted into the earth. The bear
plunged onto the shaft, sorely wounding itself.
After it ran off roaring through the rain, Marrec
crouched over Emmon. The rain turned his black hair
into a sodden mass that drained rivulets of water into
Marrec's face, but his hands were steady as he ripped
strips of cloth from his own tunic and bandaged them
around Emmon's shoulder to stem the oozing blood. Mar-
rec's eyes burned like coals, but at that time he assumed
it was pent up frustration...
Marrec saved Emmon, and both survived the punish-
ments given them by their parents for their foolishness.
When Marrec reached his sixteenth year, he took a com-
mission with the village militia, such as it was. Though
his adopted father would have preferred Marrec enter the
family business, he was supportive of his son's decision.
After all, Marrec was something of a natural when it
came to the arts of the warrior. Though far less suited,
Emmon followed Marrec's example.

THE
RIESTS
CHAPTER 4
The crash of metal and a gurgling roar startled
Marrec from reverie. He hadn't gone more than
a mile since leaving Fullpoint behind. Thrusting
aside the forest growth without further regard
for stealth, Marrec rushed forward several dozen
feet. His dash ended as he broke out of the trees
into a shaded glade.
He arrived in time to witness Gunggari slam
his warclub into a rot fiend's head. The blighted
creature was one of half a dozen more pustule-
ridden forest folk assembled in the glade in
various postures, all inimical, though a few
lay unmoving near Gunggari. Glad though he
was to see his friend, his eyes darted past the
Oslander. Standing plain as day was a massive
lion-like beast whose skin was so encrusted with
fungus that it seemed a shade of green. Marrec
estimated that the lion stood six feet tall at the

--- Page 36 ---
shoulder. The beast screamed, giving voice to the same
shattering roar that Marrec had first heard. It was root-
ing after something caught in the bole of a large tree.
"By the Circle of Leth, you shall not have her!" called
out a female voice.
A woman in warrior's garb dropped into view from
above the dire beast, swinging a leaf-shaped blade. She
had been hiding in the tree. Her fall was purposeful;
she struck the fungal lion a nasty blow with her blade
as she fell past. Her precipitous drop ended in an expert
roll that not only cushioned her impact but also put her
just out of range of the beast's first claw swipe. Marrec
didn't know who the woman was, but she already had his
respect.
Then he saw the little girl behind the tree. She had to
be Hemish's foundling, Ash.
Marrec bolted forward, trying to skirt the volodnis.
Gunggari would be able to deal with them. He hoped.
Marrec doubted that the valorous woman would do as
well against the savage beast without some help. It was
his cue to act.
A bolt of black rot diverted Marrec. One of the rot
fiends was tossing around potent magic. The bolt missed,
striking an old tree stump. The stump immediately began
to rot and molder. Marrec hoped the courageous woman
could hold out a few more seconds against the beast. He
first had to deal with the blighted forest creature that
was versed in sorcery, and not a pleasant sort of sorcery.
He pointed his spear at the one who'd cast the enchant-
ment his way, saying, "Leave, and we'll let you go without
harm."
The one he pointed to sneered, breaking open a fluid-
filled boil on its face as it did so. "It is you who should
leave. We require the Horned Aspect. Lest blight take
you, deliver her!"
Horned Aspect? He'd worry about that later. Too many
names to match up with faces, though he wondered if the
28. THE PRIESTS

--- Page 37 ---
creature referred to Ash. He decided that his job of the
moment was to see that the sorcerer ate its words.
Almost of its own accord, Justlance took flight. He
knew even as the shaft left his grasp that it would speed
true. He had just time enough to see the sorcerer's filmy
eyes widen before another volodni knocked him to his
knees with a blow from behind. Where'd that little
stinker come from?
He tried to spin around and back, though it was dif-
ficult on his knees. His immediate aggressor clutched an
iron-headed mace. It grinned. "Too bad you had to kill
Molkai," it said, gesturing to where the sorcerer volodni
was pinned to a tree by Justlance. "Now I kill you, easy."
The mace-wielder had no way of knowing Marrec's
secret, so when the rot fiend's triumphant charge ended
suddenly on the point of Justlance, its look of surprise be-
fore it expired was absolutely justified. An instant prior
to stopping the charge, Justlance left the quivering body
of the nearby volodni sorcerer. His spear could never be
parted from its owner for long.
Gunggari had about mopped up the last of the re-
maining volodnis. Marrec levered himself to his feet
and looked for Ash... Ah! The child still sheltered partly
behind the roots of the large tree. Ash's unknown female
protector was also still in the game, rushing in to hack
at the fungal lion, then dancing away just in time to
avoid a lethal claw swipe. If the creature hadn't been so
focused on going back for the child, Marrec wondered if
the woman would have fared so well. Each time it broke
off its pursuit of the woman, she slashed it again with her
blade. Still, she was obviously tired, while the greened
lion seemed as strong as ever despite several lines of its
own blood on its sides and some quantity of the same
squalid fluid the volodnis leaked.
"Let's get the cat, Gunggari!" shouted Marrec as he
dashed in on the lion's flank.
The woman heard him, too. As he came up behind and
BRUCE R. CORDELL • 29
.

--- Page 38 ---
to one side of the lion and gave it a good jab with his spear,
she closed on the opposite side, her leaf-shaped sword
stabbing and slashing. The lion turned and swatted at
him with a huge claw, green with rot, but he got out of the
way. The woman got in another few telling blows, taking
advantage of the creature's divided attention.
Gunggari finally showed up, his dizheri soaked and
matted with evidence of its recent work. He swung it
around with both hands, connecting solidly with the side
of the creature's head. It yelped, blinking, and shook its
head.
"It's dazed," yelled the woman. "Finish it!"
Marrec didn't need to be told twice. He and Justlance
got to work. With another mighty bash from the dizheri,
the lion collapsed, unmoving.
In the ensuing quiet, Marrec and Gunggari eyed the
woman. Dressed in sturdy brown and green leathers, she
looked like she was more than at home in the forest. Of
course! Her thin build and elongated features-she was
an elf, though her hair hid the most tell-tale sign.
Marrec said to her, across the length of the unmov-
ing lion, "I am Marrec. Gunggari," he inclined his head
toward the Oslander, "and I chased these monsters down.
They kidnapped a child from a village they attacked." He
gestured back toward the girl. "Her father will be over-
joyed to discover your part in saving her. Thank you."
The elf smiled in acknowledgement but said nothing.
She looked over to where Ash sheltered.
Ash had left the tree's shadow and walked tentatively
up to join them. All eyes fixed on the frail girl dressed in
a simple peasant dress.
The girl glanced at each of them for a second, and said,
"Ash."
She looked to be between four and five years of age.
The unicorn warrior looked the child over for inju-
ries. She seemed unscratched. Poor little tyke. He ruffled
Ash's hair. The girl merely looked at him, staying silent.
30 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 39 ---
No doubt she was still frightened by her recent kidnap-
ping. He felt an instant fatherly affection for her, partly
because he couldn't help identifying with her. They were
both orphans, though of course he wondered if her actual
origin could be as strange as his own.
"What did she say?" wondered the elf.
"Ash is her name," indicated Marrec, looking to the
girl then back to the woman.
The elf figured out his unspoken question. She smiled
again and raised her sword to her brow, as if a salute. "I
am Elowen. I am a Nentyar hunter in service with the Cir-
cle of Leth. I've been trailing these volodnis for some time,
trying to find out more about their recent incursions."
Marrec was unfamiliar with most of those names.
He decided to pursue the rot fiend topic. "They look like
volodnis of which I've heard, but there is something
wrong with these," he said, pointing at the corpses.
"Yes," continued Elowen. "These poor creatures suffer
from an infection of body and mind. When unaflicted,
we call them the pine folk, too. They normally live in
the Lethyr Forest, the Rawlinswood, and the forests of
Rashemen. These are a fair bit south of their natural
ranges."
"I've heard of volodnis but never seen them before,"
responded Marrec. "I've heard that they can be vengeful
protectors of the forest. Perhaps the people of Ash's vil-
lage somehow riled them up?"
Elowen rubbed her jaw and said, "Well, they can be
antagonistic to the 'warm folk' as they call us. But I as-
sure you, as a servant of the Nentyarch, I've dealt several
times with volodnis, and none are like these. Volodnis do
not normally rot as if dead but continue to draw breath.
These are...
и
"They are evil," finished Gunggari.
She nodded, then looked to Gunggari and back to
Marrec. "If you haven't seen volodnis before, you must
come from far away."
BRUCE R. CORDELL 31

--- Page 40 ---
She grinned, looking again at Gunggari. "Especially
you."
The Oslander offered a tiny smile back at her, said,
"Far, far to the south was my home. Where I come from,
everything is different. I am an explorer."
"Indeed. And you?" Her gaze was back on Marrec.
Marrec answered, "I hail from the west, where I serve
the goddess Lurue. I am here because... this child is
somehow important to the goddess, though I have as yet
no understanding of how that could be."
Elowen rubber her palms together. "Let us compare
stories, and perhaps some pieces may come together for
all of us."
"Great. Let's start with why you were trailing these
creatures," said Marrec.
Elowen replied, "As I said, this rot is not something
volodnis have exhibited before. As an agent of Leth, it
is my job to protect the forests for the Nentyarch. If the
volodnis are suffering from disease or have leagued with
evil, I need to know. That's why I'm here following this
particular group. Plus, I have a friend up in Two Stars
who promised to help me out. She owes me."
"Whoa... slow down," said Marrec. "I have no idea
what you're talking about. Explain it to me as if I were
a complete stranger to your land." He let a smile touch
his lips.
"Sure. The Forest of Lethyr to the northwest of here is
home to the followers of the Nentyarch. The Nentyarch
is a very, very powerful druid, and he and his followers
are collectively known as the Circle of Leth..."
"And the Nentyar hunters serve the Circle, right?"
guessed Marrec.
"Right. I'm a hunter. We're a group made up of rangers,
scouts, and warriors. We carry out the commands of the
druid circle voluntarily, for the good of the forest. When
we join in service, we swear to defend the great forests
and do the Nentyarch's bidding."
32. THE PRIESTS

--- Page 41 ---
"My goddess Lurue has often found common ground
with druids," offered Marrec.
"Her name is one honored by the Circle, I've heard.
What brings a servant of Lurue so far east?"
"Her silence," muttered the cleric.
Elowen waited for more.
"Something is not right with Lurue. I've been follow-
ing portents, looking for a promised Child of Light who
will... somehow make things right. I think Ash is the
child, but now that I've found her, I'm not sure what to
do next."
Gunggari said, "These evil pine men are caught up
in Ash's fate and maybe Lurue's. If we discover the pine
men's interest, maybe we can find out why she's impor-
tant to Lurue."
"A lot of maybes," opined Marrec, "but I have nothing
better to go on. Ash is not talking at the moment." He
patted the mute child on the head. "We need to find out
more about these blighted volodnis-these rot fiends." He
looked back at Elowen.
"Agreed," said Elowen. "You are welcome to join me to
see my friend in Two Stars. She is an adept of many lores,
and she may know something about these volodnis. Then
I must report back to the Nentyarch. It's been too long
since I've gone back... but Ususi should be consulted, now
that we have this new information in hand."
"Ususi is your friend?"
"Ususi Manaallin. She also hails from a place far
distant from here. She came here long ago, and her
knowledge of certain mystical sites of the forest is un-
surpassed, even by the Nentyarch himself. She knows the
Mucklestones especially well."
"Why do we care about mucklestones?" wondered
Marrec. "Because, these blighted volodnis I have been
following issued from that ancient site just over a month
ago.
I witnessed their departure. Of late, I've spent much
time in the vicinity of the Mucklestones..." The elf
"
BRUCE R. CORDELL 33

--- Page 42 ---
smiled fondly as if over some personal memory. "Anyway,
something evil has taken root in the Mucklestones, and of
all the people I know, Ususi best knows the Mucklestones.
She has made their study her work."
"Exactly where are the Mucklestones located?" asked
Marrec, that time pronouncing the name with the proper
gravity. The place seemed like it must be important and
perhaps somehow connected to Ash, and if so, then also
to Lurue.
"They are at the northeastern tip of the Forest of Le-
thyr. The city of Two Stars is not too far out of the way, if
the Mucklestones prove to be our eventual destination."
Marree considered, still standing close to the child.
The girl looked at him, saying nothing, and reacting
not at all to the field of slain creatures around her. If
Ash truly was the Child of Light, whatever the true
significance of that name, and if the volodnis were after
her because of it, she wouldn't be safe back in her village.
She'd be safest with him, Gunggari, and perhaps with
the hunter Elowen. After all, Elowen had already saved
Ash once.
Marrec decided. "Gunggari, we're going to Two Stars.
Ash is going with us."
"What about the peasant, Hemish?" wondered the tat-
tooed soldier. "He will want his daughter back."
"Don't worry, we'll go back and satisfy Hemish that
the girl will be safest in our care. If he truly wants what's
best for the child's welfare, he'll allow her to remain with
us. It may be that Ash is blessed with a secret, perhaps
even the secret behind Lurue's silence."
It was decided. Elowen indicated she'd accompany him
and Gunggari back to Fullpoint, being grateful for their
help in slaying the evil pine folk, and hopeful that their
involvement might aid her efforts in the future.
34. THE PRIESTS

--- Page 43 ---
The blightlord laughed as the druid's screams bel-
lowed forth. The druid, named Briartan, was convulsed
with pain, though his strength was sufficient to keep the
blightlord's awful infection at bay.
Still chuckling, the dark figure regarded Briartan
where the druid was impaled, a metal stake puncturing
the palm of each hand so that the druid hung against one
of the sacred obelisks of the stone circle. Though a filigree
of rot frosted the stone all around the druid, Briartan's
body remained uninfected, if bloody.
The blightlord, named Gameliel, asked "Still resist,
do you? It matters not, really. I already know everything
you are trying so hard to avoid telling me." So saying,
the figure extended the night black haft of its horrible
weapon and gently lifted the necklace bearing the Key-
stone from around Briartan's head.
The druid kicked out with his leg, striking his evil tor-
menter in his armored chest. "You can't have it, Gameliel."
The blightlord snarled. Gameliel lashed forward with
the weapon's void-dark blade. He severed Briartan's of-
fending leg with a single swipe.
The severed limb slid limply down the stone slab from
which Briartan still dangled, pumping blood. The druid's
scream ripped forth once more, echoing among the encir-
cling stones, but dying away to nothing in the branches
of the surrounding forest.
A new master ruled the Mucklestones.
Back in Fullpoint, Hemish proved difficult to persuade.
"Are you joking, man? Leave my daughter in your
care? I thank you for returning her, but after all, you are
a stranger to me and her!" yelled Hemish.
Marrec, sitting across the table from Hemish, studied
the dancing flame of the single lamp hanging above the
table. He and Hemish had gone back and forth for some
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 35

time, but it didn't feel like he was getting through to the
man. The child Ash sat in a small chair nearby, her legs
dangling above the floor, a stuffed toy languishing in
her lap as she stared straight ahead at a sight only she
could see.
Marrec leaned toward the peasant and said, "Listen.
Can't you see that this is not a singular occurrence? If
it happened once, it could happen again, and we won't be
here next time to save her."
Hemish glowered and muttered, "How many times can
a man's child be taken? The odds were long to begin with.
Lightning doesn't strike the same place twice."
The cleric sighed, shaking his head. "True-if this
were only a random occurrence. Haven't you heard a
thing I've said? I believe these tree people were specially
seeking Ash. They didn't succeed. That means they'll try
again. And again and again until they finally get what
they're after. My friends and I cannot stay here to guard
here night and day-we have business in Two Stars. If you
truly care for the safety of your daughter, you'd wipe the
sentiment from your eyes and see the truth. Allow me to
protect her. I swear I'll guard her as my own."
Hemish took one of the girl's unresponsive arms in his
own. He looked into Ash's eyes, and said, "Is that all right
with you, baby? Do you want to go with this man? You'll
be safe. Tell me what you want."
The girl intoned, "Ash."
Hemish's eyes brimmed. He patted the girl's hand then
caught Marrec's eyes with his own. "You swear on your
service to your goddess that you will keep Ash safe from
all harm?"
Marrec rose, drew Justlance and held it before him. He
said, "I swear, upon Lurue's name, that I shall guard Ash
with all my ability, keeping her safe from harm. She will
be more dear to me than my own life. I so swear."
Hemish sighed. After a minute of silence he said, "Very
well, cleric. I must trust you, it seems."

--- Page 45 ---
Marrec reached out and clasped Hemish's hand. He
said, "You are making the right choice. Don't worry."
Really, there could be no other outcome.
They spent the night in Fullpoint. In the morning,
Marrec, Gunggari, Elowen, and Ash departed. Much of
the village was gathered to see off the heroes who had
defended the town from the "raiding tree people." Many
did not understand why Ash was departing, too. Few
seemed unduly upset by it save, of course, for a tearful
Hemish.
When all the goodbyes were said, they headed out.
Elowen led the group northeast. Their destination was
Two Stars. Marrec's single hope was that Elowen's friend
might shed light on the question of Ash's identity. What
was the significance of the Child of Light, and how had
the volodnis fallen into the clasp of evil?
Joining the militia seemed to be one of the best moves
of Marrec's young life. He reveled in the weapon drills,
the warrior's training, and the endless mock duels with
the other young men of the village with similar hearts.
Not so Emmon. Though quick enough with his wits,
Marrec's step-brother wasn't too swift when it came to
arms and armor. The drilling required of all those in the
militia made little dent in Emmon's inability to properly
wield a sword. Emmon and Marrec were thick; Marrec
helped Emmon perfect his skills, while Emmon was
happy just to be around Marrec. They were friends.
When not training in the militia, Marrec and Em-
mon enjoyed taking short walks outside of the village, to
the edges of the forest and sometimes past. The two boys
made a contest of who would be the first to sight some
small game animal, tree, or other interesting feature of
the Wild. They had a favorite haunt near the edge of the
river, where a small cave provided the perfect hide-out
BRUCE R. CORDELL 37

--- Page 46 ---
from adults and the responsibilities expected of those
coming of age.
The raids started around that time.
Horrible creatures out of the wild found the village,
and for reasons of their own, they decided it would make
an ideal target of terrorism and piracy. The raiders were
a tribe of brutish, manlike ogres who called themselves
the Durang, after their leader. Not interested in conces-
sions, the Durang launched a career of attacks on the
town. At first just outlying farms were hit, but it was
clear that the Durang were intent on striking to the very
heart of the village, and soon.
So it was time for the militia to do the job it had
trained for. Defend the village. Marrec looked forward
to the coming encounter with a strange, tight feeling in
his stomach. He looked forward to being tested in actual
battle, yet he was nervous. He didn't let that show to his
comrades, who were all outwardly afraid. Emmon put on
a brave face, but Marrec knew his brother well enough
to know that on the inside, Emmon was just this side of
fleeing for all he was worth.
The crash on the hastily-constructed palisade wall
signaled that the time for wondering was past. It was
time to fight.
Another crash, and the Durang were through. Some
of his fellow militiamen were stunned, thinking that
the barrier should have lasted longer. No time for that.
Yellow-skinned brutes with thick, warty skin boiled in
through the breach. Marrec was among the few brave
enough to meet the initial onslaught. He had chosen
a spear, which he judged he could use more profitably
against the eight-foot-tall Durang. Plus, ever since the
incident with bear in the woods, Marrec simply preferred
the spear.
A particularly ill-kempt brute with greasy hair
charged him, brandishing a great club of splintered
wood. Marrec felt fear melt away before the immediacy
38
•
THE PRIESTS

--- Page 47 ---
of his predicament. Fear would only get in the way of the
actions he must take in order to survive.
He ducked under the monster's first swing, jumped up
instantly and drove his spear into the Durang's temple.
Just like that, the creature was vanquished. Marrec yelled
in jubilation, wrenching his spear free from the carcass.
Who's next? he wondered.
Things weren't going nearly so well for the rest of
the militiamen. Even one Durang was a match for two
or three humans, and there were at least eight ogres by
Marrec's count. Over to his left, the drillmaster Rimmard
stood his ground well enough, but everywhere else the
Durang encroached. Not a single militiaman was unin-
jured, except for himself and maybe Rimmard.
His eyes found Emmon. His half-brother lay twisted,
unmoving, his broken sword several feet from his splayed
grip. "Emmon?" Marrec rushed to the body of his step-
brother.
Emmon was dead.
Rage took Marrec. The boy felt his own humanity
splinter and fall away, as if it were snake skin. His eyes
had started burning the moment the attack began. See-
ing his dead brother, it felt as if the very orbs were afire.
Marree screamed, clutching his head with both hands.
His head felt molten, and his eyes brimmed with the
blaze inside.
Why not let the anger out? something whispered. Why
not?
Marrec allowed his hands to fall away from his head.
Despite the pain, his gaze was infused with a deadly clar-
ity. As if burrowing a channel in the air with his gaze, he
unleashed the fury within at the ogre nearest the fallen
body of Emmon, but the ogre was not burned.
It was turned to stone.
A great hush extended from the first unmoving ogre,
growing in radius like a rock dimples a pond, ever-
widening as defenders and ogres alike paused to see
BRUCE R. CORDELL 39

--- Page 48 ---
what had occurred. A long sigh was heard, or maybe it
was a collective gasp of fear from villagers and attack-
ers, as startled eyes alighted on Marrec then flinched
quickly away.
Then the remaining raiders were running, running
from his invincible gaze. He cared not. He was in a swoon
of anger and loss.
Emmon still lay dead at Marrec's feet. His gaze was
spent, and the fury subsided to a dull ache deep within
his head. All was silent. Villager gazes continued to scat-
ter away from him like water on a hot skillet, afraid to
commit. A murmur of astonishment grew, but more than
just astonishment, there was also fear. Fear of him. The
freak. The monster.
So he was. The bitter truth was apparent to all. The
townspeople wanted nothing more to do with him, despite
his victory over the Durang. His blood was tainted with
an unknown but likely devilish power, he was told. He
was outcast, even by his own family.
So it was that Marrec fled into the Wild.

RIESTS
CHAPTER 5
They sought the city of Two Stars, Elowen in the
lead, the rest following after.
Marrec tried to carry Ash piggy-back, but she
seemed more comfortable walking, so their pace
in the lightly forested country was measured
to the pace of a young child. Marrec knew that
would have to change, but he was willing to al-
low the child her head for the moment. Perhaps
later they could purchase a small horse or pony
for the girl to ride upon.
Elowen was familiar with the country and
could get them back on the road called the
Golden Way without backtracking along the
path Marrec and Gunggari had used to reach
Fullpoint. Marrec knew little of the land, but he
was learning more with each day. He did know
that the city of Two Stars girdled the Golden
Way and was an important city in the land of

--- Page 50 ---
Thesk, which was the ungainly name of that far land
where Marrec found himself.
Marrec reflected back on his journey since he'd reached
the eastern shore of the Sea of Fallen Stars. He and
Gunggari had first disembarked in the city of Telflamm
after their passage east across the Sea. Telflamm was
the founding city of the Golden Way. For thousands of
miles the great trade road wended eastward, eventually
joining Faerûn to the fabulous lands of Kara-Tur, Mar-
rec was assured. Along the road lay the merchant towns
that comprised the realm of Thesk, the crossroads of the
Unapproachable East. All that was revealed to Marrec
upon landfall, but he wasn't sure he believed much of
what was told him in the thief-ruled city of Telflamm.
At the time, he just wanted to find Fullpoint, though he
did recall seeing a map showing Two Stars situated not.
much farther along the great trade road.
While on the great trade road, they'd passed through
countless smaller villages, and three larger cities,
Phent, Phsant, and Tammar. The towns of Phent and
Tammar had offered no trouble, but in Phsant their
ignorance of local custom had caused a few problems.
Somehow-Marrec wasn't sure exactly how-Gunggari
had earned the displeasure of someone called the
Golden Master. Marrec didn't really worry about it
until they discovered hundreds of soldiers loyal to
the Golden Master mustered against them as they at-
tempted to exit the city from the strangely named Shou
quarter. They'd barely escaped. One thing was sure-he
and Gunggari wouldn't be going back through Phsant
if they could help it.
Marrec hoped Two Stars wasn't all that far from Full-
point. Surely it would be a quick journey, at least after he
made some sort of arrangement for Ash's transportation.
Perhaps he should consult with their guide.
"Elowen?" called Marree from the rear. He was
making certain that Ash walked ahead of him, never
42 .
THE PRIESTS

--- Page 51 ---
allowing the girl out of his sight. "How far to Two Stars
did you say?"
Elowen paused in her conversation with Gunggari,
looking back. Marrec was glad to see those two seemed
to be getting along. "No more than a couple of days,
Marrec; it's about sixty miles. Not to worry. This foliage
gives way to grassland soon enough. If we were traveling
through a real forest, like the Lethyr or Rawlinswood,
you'd know it."
Marrec nodded, satisfied.
Elowen walked, excited at her chance meeting in the
wood. Her senses were attuned to the wildlife of leaf and
bough, but more than others of her order, she enjoyed
conversation. Sadly, the creatures and plants in her care
were mostly unskilled in that area. These strangers had
many stories to tell and offered the chance for conversa-
tions many and long.
More importantly, the strangers were concerned with
the troubles of the wood, just like her. They seemed spe-
cifically concerned about the troubles caused by these
rot-touched volodnis, as was she. She feared that where
blight moved so fearlessly, only one possible agency
could be responsible... but she had to be sure before she
reported back to the Circle. That was a conversation she
did not relish. She had stayed away far too long-and the
longer she stayed away, the more difficult it had become
each day to set her feet back toward her fellows. After
all, she had been pursuing her mission, however delayed
it had become.
"The trees are yours to guard?" asked Gunggari, who
walked beside her on the road to Two Stars.
"Not quite," responded Elowen. "Nentyar hunters, such
as myself, are few. We don't patrol specific areas. Rather,
we are free to wander widely, trusting our own judgment,
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 43
•

--- Page 52 ---
but yes, we confront all who seek to harm the forest."
Gunggari fell quiet, apparently satisfied.
The southlander was a puzzle to Elowen, but an in-
teresting puzzle. She'd never seen anybody like him. A
human, to be sure, but one with customs unlike she'd
ever come upon before then. He intrigued her. She hoped
they would accompany her back to the Mucklestones.
Her friend Briartan would love to meet someone from
so far abroad.
"What about you?" Elowen asked the tattooed soldier.
"What is the significance of all those marks on your
body? They seem too exquisite to be mere decoration."
Gunggari considered a moment, then said, "In Osse, in
the land where my mother bore me, these tattoos speak of
my strength, skill, and dedication to alcheringa."
Elowen looked at Gunggari, waiting for him to con-
tinue.
"Alcheringa is the philosophy of my people. I walk that
path. These marks on my body are totems, each telling
of an ancestral hero of my people. I call on them for aid
when I am in need. That is alcheringd
"Who's this one?" Elowen impudently pointed at a
vaguely human tattoo on Gunggari's chest. "He's got a
warclub like yours."
"Tumbarum. He is the spirit of music. He plays the
dizheri. Like so."
Gunggari hefted his hollow war club, upon which were
painted elaborate designs in bright colors, and began to
blow through one end. A sound, as of thunder, or a rush-
ing river, reverberated through the air. Startled, a nearby
flock of birds gave flight. The sound was unlike anything
she had ever heard. Gunggari continued to blow. The
thought occurred to her that it was music of a sort the
elves had never mastered, something she could scarcely
credit. His warclub was a musical instrument. Truly a
marvel.
After a time, Gunggari finished. Elowen said, "You
44 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 53 ---
are a master musician, Gunggari. Among my people, you
would be accorded much honor for that alone."
The Oslander stowed his instrument and nodded,
taking her at her word, without humility or arrogance.
Gunggari was simply a man who knew his worth.
He said, "You have made my friend Marrec very happy,
appearing when you did, saving the child. He has long
sought that child; you have made a friend of him and me."
So saying, Gunggari clapped her on the shoulder.
Such familiarity between herself and strangers was
uncommon, and normally she would resent such contact,
but she was surprised to find that, coming from the
strange man from the south with his strange customs,
she didn't mind.
A pony named Henri was procured for Ash in the
village of Culdorn that evening. The group had covered
just fifteen miles, but they did reach the great trade
road, the Golden Way. They put up that night in the
Culdorn Inn. Ash was completely taken with Henri; she
was far more interested in the little horse than with
her companions. The girl tried to sleep with the pony
in the stable instead of the room they arranged for her
and Elowen to share. That was, by far, the most emotion
the child had yet generated for anything, and Marrec
was pleased. Perhaps the mount would prove a bridge by
which Ash could be reached.
The next day the four traveled swiftly down the Gold-
en Way. Henri was amenable to the pace set. Elowen and
Gunggari were used to traveling light and quickly, but
Marrec, too, could move fast when necessary. Before the
sun dipped down on their flank, sending their shadows
ahead like dusky fingers, they covered a full thirty miles.
Elowen indicated they had only a half day's travel to look
forward to the next day.
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 45

--- Page 54 ---
They made camp alongside the road that night. Elowen
got a fire going with Gunggari's aid in scavenging suitable
brush and dead branches. Tiny sparks drifted up from the
fire, blending with the stars above. Gunggari told a story
drawn from the mythology of his people, as he sometimes
did, but only with much cajoling from Marrec. That night,
he launched into the telling on his own initiative. It was
a story about rain.

CHAPTER 6
Rain woke Marrec in the gray light of dawn.
Clouds scrolled across the sky, brushing water
in great grey arcs across the soggy landscape.
He sat up and rubbed the sleep from his eyes, the
water from his hair, then stood to check on Ash.
They'd rigged a simple lean-to for the girl, which
had kept out most of the rain. She still slept
under its protection, curled up in her blanket.
Henri stood protectively nearby, his coat damp
and curled. Marrec could smell the beast's damp
fur-distinctive, but not unpleasant.
Elowen and Gunggari were up, too, striking
camp. Despite the gloom rain normally evoked in
Marrec, he was excited to be up and on his way.
Two Stars was close.
The countryside was as pleasant an example
of Faerûn countryside as Marrec had ever seen.
Perhaps it was the rain, but the pastures had

--- Page 56 ---
a radiant greenness, like stained-glass windows. There
were a few tall pine trees, and larger, uncut copses, that
served as reminders that once a much greater forest
existed thereabout. In places, cream-colored stone was
visible rising out of the soil. The forest had given way to
crops and pastures.
Later, the rain dried up, though the countryside re-
mained clammy and misty. Elowen was good at her word,
and before noon they spied the gates of Two Stars. The
Golden Way passed into the city, then along the great
curve of the city's inner wall. It appeared as if much of
the road within the city was a great trade bazaar. Within
the gates he spied many buildings, some temples, and one
large castle. At one point, the Golden Way appeared to
veer away from the city wall and actually pass through
the gates of the castle and out the other side. Within the
gates of the castle, the trade route bisected another large
road. Marrec thought that it might be the Cold Road, if
his memory of maps he had studied was accurate.
"Who holds the castle?" asked Gunggari.
Elowen answered, "That's Gallidy Castle. Lady Yolatir
Gallidy is the latest to govern Two Stars. She's not es-
pecially heavy handed, and lets the trade flow pretty
much unhindered. As you can guess, she's a favorite of
the guilds."
"Two Stars. That's a nice name," said Marrec, as they
continued to move toward the city.
"I believe it is named for the stars of the east and west
that 'meet' in the heavens overhead. A good omen for
trade, they say."
Marrec nodded, and they headed into town. The influx
of those entering Two Stars was checked by toll collec-
tors. Apparently their lack of a trade wagon made the
group exempt from tax, and they were waved through.
"Let's go see your friend straightaway," said Marrec.
"We can find an inn later."
Elowen nodded and started down the Golden Way.
48 ⚫ THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 57 ---
It was bustling with carts, temporary and permanent
storefronts, and the conversation of what seemed like
thousands of people buying and selling all manner of
things. The assortment of people was no less strange.
Marrec guessed that he saw at least thirty different rac-
es, including a few gnolls, giants, and orcs in fine cloth,
which was a racial mixture he rarely if ever encountered
in the west.
The amount of space given over to trade was re-
ally quite impressive. The larger side avenues were
lined with tents of jugglers, puppeteers, dancing girls,
hammer-throwers, fire-swallowers, and hedge wizards
of every stripe. But along the main trade road was where
the real merchandise could be found. There were tables,
stalls, and the cleverly fashioned unfolding wagons of
merchants who'd lugged their goods from all corners
of Faerûn. Cattle, food, timber, iron, oysters, wool, gem-
stones, parchment and inks, glass, weaponry, charms of
real power, and a host of additional items too many to
take note of were bought and sold. The constant scream of
conversation in dozens of languages, but mostly variously
accented Common, was almost oppressive.
The crowds made their walk a slow one, as they did
their best to ignore the cries and promises of the mer-
chants on either side. Finally, Elowen found a side-street
that was apparently not part of the trade road, for only a
few people walked along the muddy-track. The buildings
on either side seemed more given to warehousing than
retailing.
Gunggari breathed a slight sigh of relief. Marrec
knew the Oslander hated crowds. On the other hand, Ash
seemed oblivious as she happily rode on the back of her
pony. Marrec had been a little apprehensive that the child
would react poorly to such a press of strangers.
Before too long they reached a tenement district. Chil-
dren played in the narrow streets, knocking a wooden
ball back and forth with a stout club. Elowen got her
BRUCE R. CORDELL 49

--- Page 58 ---
bearings, then made her way down a tight alley, which
opened into an unkempt grassy courtyard that hid be-
hind the backs of four buildings.
The top of a dome-shaped structure protruded from
the ground at courtyard's center, rising no more than
waist-high. Small holes pocked the surface of the dome,
each punching a shaft down into darkness. Near the
dome, broad stone stairs plunged down nine steep steps
to a door. Marrec realized that the door probably allowed
access to the interior of the buried structure. He surmised
it was the home or lab of Elowen's friend, Ususi.
Marrec lifted Ash off Henri's back.
"Wait here, why don't you?" he muttered to Henri as
he hobbled the pony.
Elowen led the way down the steps to the door. She put
her hand to the knocker, striking three times, paused,
then two more, a final pause, then a single loud rap. She
glanced back and said, "That's to let Ususi know it's me."
"Nice," Marrec commented with the hint of a grin.
After a wait of just under half minute, a woman ap-
peared at the door. She almost smiled when she saw the elf
hunter. "Elowen. I wondered what had become of you." She
glanced at Marrec, Gunggari, and Ash. What might have
been a smile froze into a less welcoming expression. "And
I see you've brought friends." The woman had a noticeable
accent, but one Marrec couldn't place.
More striking than her accent was the woman's skin,
which was a pale, stony color, complete with what almost
seemed to be mineral veins running through it. Her hair
and eyes were coal black, though the hint of her initial
smile had been almost inviting. She wore a greatcoat
inlaid with arcane symbols. A surprisingly large book
was attached to her belt on her left side-Marrec had
seen other wizards carry tomes of penned spells in a
similar manner, and on her right, a small wand pouch
dyed bright yellow.
Inside, the domed ceiling proved to be pockmarked
50. THE PRIESTS

--- Page 59 ---
with skylights-those were the holes they'd seen in the
dome from the surface. The light wasn't allowed down
into the chamber unimpeded. A host of strange objects
dangled from the curved ceiling, all at slightly different
heights. Various lamps, roots of assorted bulbous shape,
sheaves of aromatic grasses, stuffed animals (mostly
birds), and other less identifiable pieces were on display.
By far the most prominent hanging items were minerals
and crystals of every sort.
On the floor level, squat bookshelves overflowed with
tomes on all sides, while a great desk in the very center of
the chamber contained piles of books, scrolls, and sheaves
of unbound paper. Ususi was obviously very scholarly, if
an avid collector of strange hangings.
"Come in. I will make tea, as you showed me, Elowen."
Ususi retreated, sighing, and began to finger through
various herbs hanging above their heads.
"You taught her to make tea?" Marrec quietly asked
Elowen as they pulled chairs from one wall. Marrec
picked up Ash and put her on one knee.
"Yes."
He'd hoped Elowen might elaborate. He wandered
about Ususi's background. The woman's skin-tone indi-
cated a place of origin even farther away than Gunggari,
possibly.
"Now then," continued Ususi, as she found a mortar and
pestle from a rear shelf, apparently to grind the leaves
she had selected, "Please tell me the purpose of such a
large gathering in my dwelling. Who is the child?"
Ash sat staring up at the throng of suspended items.
Her expression remained unchanged as she made a single
comment. "Ash."
I
"She does that," explained Marrec. "That's all she does.
mean, that's all she ever says." Unaccountably, he felt
a bit tongue-tied talking to Ususi. Must be those night
black eyes. Her eyes were dark, like twin wells with un-
plumbed depths.
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 51

--- Page 60 ---
Ususi raised an eyebrow as if to ask, 'and so?'
When the cleric didn't respond immediately, Elowen
said, "She's the reason we're here, Ususi. At least, she's
part of the reason. I'm afraid we are also here because of
the Mucklestones."
At that, Ususi paused as she was about to pour the
crushed leaves into seeping spoons. She looked concerned,
but waited for Elowen to continue.
Elowen obliged, "Corruption is abroad. I've been track-
ing a group of blighted volodnis for over a month, south
and east out of the Forest of Lethyr. We have determined
that the volodnis were searching for this girl, Ash." The
elf pointed to the child.
"Blighted volodnis?" wondered Ususi.
"I call them rot fiends," offered Marrec helpfully.
"Yes-blighted in a way that I do not fully under-
stand," Elowen continued. The elf bit her lip as if keeping
something back. "In any event, I knew you would want to
know, because they emerged from the Mucklestones."
"By the Hidden Delve," exclaimed Ususi. "I knew it.
I've been trying to access the portal stones for tendays,
unsuccessfully." Before Marrec could ask what she meant,
Ususi continued, "It's all interference, on every theurgic
channel I am able to probe. Nor could I contact Briartan,
the keeper of the stones. One other name keeps popping
up, though, through the interference: Gameliel. That
name means nothing to me, but..."
The hunter balled her fists.
Marrec asked, "Who is Gameliel?"
Elowen took a breath, said, "Gameliel is a blightlord, a
being of terrible, corrupt power." Her eyes grew flinty. "If
a blightlord is in the Forest of Lethyr, he must be rooted
out. The corruption of the volodnis I followed must have
been his doing. His doing, or his masters"."
Marrec turned the words over in his mind, looking for a
connection with Lurue or Ash. He came up blank. He said
"I'm as much in the dark as ever. Why is this Gameliel
52 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 61 ---
seeking Ash?" The problem, he decided, was that he still
couldn't come up with a connection even between Ash and
Lurue. Until he figured out that bond, he would likely
continue to be at sea.
Ususi mused, "Why indeed? More information is re-
quired. Elowen, tell us more about this blightlord, and
this master of which you speak. If we bring all the facts
to the surface, perhaps connections can be made."
"Gameliel is but one of three currently active blight-
lords. Each is powerful in his or her own right, but all
serve a still greater master. I've been afraid Gameliel was
active beyond the Rawlinswood, but I had no proof until
now. The other two blightlords are called Anammelech
and Damanda. The blightlords all serve a single master:
the Rotting Man, also called the Talontyr."
Ash, silent for so long, drew in her breath, as if in re-
sponse to the last name.
All eyes
found the child.
Ash was gazing at the hanging items, apparently
without a care in the world, or cognizance of anything
other than hanging roots, grasses, and bulbs.
When it was apparent that no further response was
forthcoming from Ash, Elowen continued, "The Rotting
Man is more aspect than mortal, but he is an aspect of de-
cay. He is one of the Circle of Lethe's most potent and long
standing enemies. If the Rotting Man's servant, Gameliel, is
abroad in Lethyr, I must find and stop him. Even if I should
succeed in that task, I must report back to the Nentyarch
himself, who must be warned of the Rotting Man's newest
embassy. He already holds most of Rawlinswood-he can't
be allowed to infect the Forest of Lethyr."
"What are these Mucklestones? Why would Gameliel
desire their control?" interjected Gunggari.
"They are ancient and potent," responded Ususi.
"Though not all their powers are understood by any
one person, save possibly for Briartan, one thing is
certain: they serve as magical portals, allowing access
BRUCE R. CORDELL 58

--- Page 62 ---
to and from distant places across, and under, Faerûn."
By the significant tone in her voice, Marrec wondered
if the strange woman knew more than she was saying
concerning the Mucklestones, but he didn't press the
woman.
"Gameliel would want them for the same reason any-
one might-in order to quickly transport himself, or his
forces, without the need to physically travel the distance
in between," said Elowen.
All were quiet for a time, considering.
Ususi poured hot tea into dainty blue stone cups and
offered them to each traveler, except for Ash.
Marrec took a sip. Interesting. Something like a cross
between citrus and cinnamon. He felt some of his travel-
induced weariness melt from him.
"Thank you," said Gunggari, also enjoying his tea.
Elowen merely sipped and smiled, evidently familiar
with the revitalizing effects of Ususi's brew. For the mo-
ment, she was content watching the steam from her cup
rise in simple loops and ribbons.
Ususi observed, "What about this child? I don't un-
derstand her role-why is she here? And the rest of you?"
She pointed to Marrec and Gunggari. The woman seemed
impatient, as if lack of understanding was a position un-
familiar to her.
Marrec's stomach sank. He realized then that Ususi
knew nothing of Ash.
Marrec sighed, "None of us understand her role. My
friend Gunggari and I are here because of her, and her
apparent connection to these Mucklestones. All I know is
that she is somehow important to my goddess Lurue."
Marrec launched into the story, telling Ususi about
the goddess' growing silence over recent years, and the
signs that finally led him to Ash, supposedly as an an-
swer to these troubles.
When Marrec finished, Ususi frowned, sipped her tea,
and offered no immediate response.
54. THE PRIESTS

--- Page 63 ---
"Well?" asked Marrec, a little impatient in his own
right.
"Your goddess is unfamiliar to me... she has not been
one of my areas of study, but," Ususi raised her hands,
forestalling Marrec's frustrated sigh, "I do have a strong
feeling about this. Unless my eldritch intuition is astray,
Briartan of the Mucklestones can provide you some an-
swers to your questions."
Elowen nodded, saying, "There is little knowledge that
Briartan does not gather to himself."
The unicorn warrior settled back, looking again at Ash.
He had hoped to return Ash to her father after the Two
Stars trip, but that was not to be, at least not immediately.
The cleric would have to take the only other option avail-
able. He'd have to travel to the Mucklestones and confront
mysterious Gameliel and demand an answer.
Marrec declared, "Then I'm going to the Mucklestones.
If Briartan can't aid me, perhaps Gameliel can answer
my questions." Gunggari nodded.
Elowen added, "You can question him, but do it quickly.
I am sworn to destroy Gameliel. Unless you object, I'd like
to continue accompanying you."
"I would welcome your company and sword arm," re-
sponded Marrec.
"The Mucklestones are my specialty," interrupted
Ususi. "I will come, too. I must learn why the portal
stones are blocked."
"It won't be safe," said Marrec. Despite her exotic
beauty, Marrec was unsure if adding this acerbic woman
to their group was a good choice.
"I possess a power of my own, which Gameliel may
learn, to his misfortune."
Marrec nodded his acquiescence, sighing. He couldn't
say no to the potential aid of a wizard. He wondered if
perhaps her presence was actually fortuitous, something
Lurue had foreseen? Perhaps he would find his answer in
the Forest of Lethyr.

CHAPTER 7
Day kindled, and the travelers were already up and
out of Two Stars, eager for an early start. Morn-
ing peeked over the shoulders of the darkened
countryside. Before them, the land was quiet
and in the pre-dawn light formless and gray, but
even as they watched, night's fingers pulled back
and colors began to bleed back into the world: the
lighter greens of the fields, the darker-hued for-
ests far off, the blue gradations of the sky with a
fleecing of white clouds, and the coffee-brown of
the road that stretched ahead.
"We can follow the Cold Road for a few miles,"
said Elowen. "After that, I know of a trail we can
take that'll shave days off our trip. Eventually,
we'll intersect the northeastern end of the Lethyr
Forest. I expect six or seven days to travel so many
miles, even with the mounts."
She looked back, seeing Marrec and Ususi

--- Page 65 ---
each astride a horse and Ash on her pony, Henri. Gung-
gari brought up the rear. Like her, the Oslander preferred
traveling on his own two feet. Despite that preference,
she knew Marrec was right in procuring mounts for
everyone. Horseback was the only way to travel the
distance in any reasonable amount of time, especially
with Ususi along. While Ususi controlled potent magic,
she apparently didn't like to squander them on anything
as mundane as transportation. The wizard seemed a bit
put out because her magical portal to the Mucklestones
was blocked. Likely Ususi had been considering a trip to
investigate even before Marrec made an appearance with
Ash, Gunggari, and herself in tow. For Ususi, Marrec's
appearance must seem a happy coincidence.
The Cold Road was in good repair, at least so close to
Two Stars. The road ran straight and wide through low
grasslands, but further on she could see the road passed
through deep groves of conifer. Farms and small commu-
nities were visible in the distance, as the sun continued
to ascend along its daily track. Elowen had not taken
the trail she intended for their group in thirteen years,
but her memory was certain. Past the next long rise, she
would break left off the road.
Behind her, she could hear Marrec quizzing Ususi. She
smiled. Ususi wasn't particularly forthcoming about her
origins. Elowen had known the woman for several years,
and only in the last few had she discovered the secret
Ususi wanted kept quiet. After all, most surface dwellers
reacted poorly when they learned that they were in the
presence of someone hailing from the Underdark.
Obviously Ususi wasn't drow or some even worse
abomination birthed in the world below the sun. In fact,
she presumed Ususi was more closely related to Marrec
than herself, with her elven blood. Ususi claimed to be
a member of a human sub-race thought extinct on the
surface, but who instead had sealed themselves into an
hidden enclave in the deepest portion of the Underdark
•
BRUCE R. CORDELL 57

--- Page 66 ---
that they could penetrate. Apparently a race of wizards,
the refugees had sealed all knowledge of their presence
behind impenetrable walls of force and illusion. Only re-
cently, after thousands of years, Ususi claimed, had those
walls begun to fail. Ususi was one of the first of her race
in generations to leave the enclave. Ususi claimed to be a
descendent of the Imaskar empire.
The name meant nothing to Elowen.
Elowen was merely glad Ususi had finally developed
enough trust in their friendship to reveal so much about
her past. The Imaskari still feared whatever drove her
ancestors into hiding, but Elowen doubted that the threat
still existed, whatever it was; Ususi would not name it.
Marrec had a long road to travel if he thought he was
going to get any information out of the wizard on such
short notice, mused Elowen. He'd have to put in his time,
as Elowen had. Soon enough, the man realized the same
thing and allowed Ususi to move ahead of his own mount.
Marrec's eyes began to focus on places other than the road
ahead. Worrying about his goddess Lurue, she guessed.
When young Marrec fled his adoptive village into the
wild, he had no clear destination. At first, getting away
was his only concern. He reviled himself, still hurting
from the insults and jeers heaped on him as he fled. Fear
drove the villagers to act out. Confused and uncompre-
hending of what his mere gaze had accomplished, Marrec
believed those taunts.
Though he sought solace in the wilderness, he fled
without preparation. He brought only a spear, clutched to
him with determination, and with some thought of using
it hunt. That first night, rain poured from a dank sky.
Cold to the bone and wet, the best shelter Marrec could
find was beneath a stout tree branch.
Things might have gone the worse for him then, but as
58. THE PRIESTS

--- Page 67 ---
fate or chance had it, Thanial Selwander found him.
Thanial was known to Marrec and others of his vil-
lage as the secretive "Man in the Wood." He appeared in
town once every few years, and Marrec had only seen the
man a few times and at a distance. His brother Emmon
had many stories to tell of the Man in the Wood, usually
involving Thanial hunting and slaying some strange new
forest beast.
Surprisingly, Thanial seemed to recognize him, say-
ing, "Marrec. So you've decided to leave the village, eh?
Things out here can be a little difficult for a novice
woodsman. Why don't you stick with me, and I'll show
what you need to know."
Marrec was astounded at Thanial's casual.greeting,
but he was happy to accept aid. His hunger was nearly as
great as the chill in his extremities, and moreover, kind-
ness seemed an unlooked for gift. He decided to put off
telling Thanial about his devil-born ability for a while.
Thanial bade Marrec to live with him in his home in
a wooded and sheltered valley between two sharp peaks.
The woodman's home was a well-constructed log house,
filled with rough amenities, including a great stone fire-
place and a dry, flagged floor. A stream flowed down from
one peak and on through the valley, its path not more
than a few feet from the house. It offered clear water for
drinking, cooking, and baking, and fish could be caught
from it, great mountain trout usually, but sometimes
salmon if the season was right.
The first night, Marrec slept on the flagged stones on a
mattress of furs, staring into the warming fire. Thanial
had a great black wolf called Shira who seemed a com-
panion than pet. Shira lay near Marrec that night, her
great muzzle protruding out like a ship's prow, sniffing
Marrec suspiciously. Thanial stepped into the next room
to prepare a meal, but Marrec fell fast asleep, and woke
with the sun and birdsong the next day.
Thanial walked in with the sun and said, "Awake at
BRUCE R. CORDELL
•

--- Page 68 ---
last, eh? Good. It's time I gave you some real training,
something to go on if you ever find yourself lost in the
woods again. You may be good with that spear, but it won't
help your hunger if you can't track a deer or bring down
a bird."
So Marrec stayed with Thanial. Somehow, Thanial
seemed to know him and know things about him. That
mystified Marrec, but since Thanial continued on in that
manner, Marrec accepted it.
Six months passed. Every day, Thanial roused him
from sleep just as morning's pink light stole into the for-
est. There was too much to do to sleep any later. Thanial
shared with Marrec a world of wonder, opportunity, and
knowledge. He trained Marree to see the web of connec-
tions that comprised nature. From the dew to the spider
webs it collected upon, to the birds that preyed on the
spiders, to the quickest cougars that brought down those
birds, and finally to life's end, which claimed all crea-
tures weak and strong, Marrec began to develop a deep
understanding of the links between all living things.
Thanial was a self-proclaimed wild ranger but also a
devout adherent of she who Thanial called the Queen of
the Forest. So Thanial was schooled in forest craft and
also in the mysteries of Thanial's Queen, called Lurue.
According to Thanial, knowledge of the first was also
knowledge of the second.
Marrec proved an apt pupil. The more he learned, the
more he realized that the spirit of Lurue was something
he could love and cherish. Not only was she the goddess
of the animals but also a free spirit of adventure and
happiness. She was a guide for those who wished for
no home but the wild. At that time, he decided that he
would devote himself to the goddess, and serve her needs
in the world.
One morning Thanial woke him with a strangely seri-
ous air.
"What is it?" Marrec asked.
60 .THE PRIESTS

--- Page 69 ---
"It's time I showed you something. I wasn't going to,
but I've changed my mind. I think you're old enough."
Thanial had a leather satchel in his hands, worn and
obviously very old.
It wouldn't be out of character for Thanial to lure
Marrec into a false sense of alarm, only to laugh uproari-
ously when the true situation, usually somehow comedic,
became apparent. Marrec ruefully shook his head and
smiled. "All right, lay it on me Thanial."
Thanial laid the satchel down across the great table
he and Marrec had built from lengths of pine. As serious
as a stone, he undid the old leather ties then carefully
removed from it an object: A glazed stone bulb the size of
a fist from which a short stone handle stretched. Tassels
with small charms and beads were tied to the handle.
As Thanial removed from the object from the satchel, it
rattled. It was a child's rattle.
Marrec's face flushed, and his eyes grew wide. He knew
that rattle. It was his, from his earliest childhood.
"Where...?"
"You had it clutched in your hand when I found you,"
explained Thanial gently. "It was I who found you, a child
in the forest, sixteen years ago almost. It was I who asked
the cobbler to take you in to make a home for the orphan
I found lying all alone in the woods."
"You found me?" Marrec didn't know where to start.
"But where? Why? I don't understand."
"Your adoptive father thought it best to indicate that
it had been he who found you, not I. That's all."
Marrec swallowed, but he could see that Thanial had
more to say. "What else?"
"When I found you... you were not exactly as you ap-
pear now. Oh, from a distance you seemed a human child
of nearly two years, crying, red faced, clutching your
rattle, but when I bent to retrieve you from the forest
floor, I saw something I didn't want to believe. I thought
at first it was a parasite, but I was wrong. Curling up
BRUCE R. CORDELL - 61

--- Page 70 ---
through your black hair were tiny... serpents. They were
rooted, as if hair, in your head."
Marrec heard a rushing noise in his ears. He stared at
Thanial, uncomprehending.
Thanial continued, "I took my blade and severed them.
I didn't think twice. I cut them out by their roots. They
didn't grow back. You didn't seem to miss them. In fact,
you acted like any toddler would act, though at first I
feared otherwise; I feared some monstrous influence. But
no, at least one of your parents was obviously human. You
were perfectly harmless. I kept you for a time, but I knew
I couldn't raise you right. I gave you up to the village. I
gave you up so you could have a real family."
Still Marree couldn't utter a word. As he did uncon-
sciously every day of his life, he raised a hand to his brow
and with his fingers probed above his hairline for the
hidden scars.

THE RIESTS
CHAPTER 8
The edge of the main forest was dark and close.
Clouds tumbled across the sky, gray and vast,
and from their bellies they unleashed yet an-
other downpour.
Forest leaves caught the falling rain, deflect-
ing it from its original goal of the moist earth,
but only temporarily. Tiny trickles of water
collected and ran down the columns of conifer,
pine, and the occasional grove of silver aspen,
green with spring growth. The Forest of Lethyr
sheltered trees of many sorts within its confines,
but all were glad, in their own way, to feel the
rain on their boughs.
Five riders, one no more than a child, entered
the eaves of the forest, eager to gain some protec-
tion from the sudden spring rain. The group hailed
from Two Stars, having crossed the intervening
distance in just a little more than a tenday.

--- Page 72 ---
The elven woman in the lead raised a hand and called
for a pause. She said, "We've entered Lethyr." She slipped
easily from her saddle to stand on the rain-soaked
ground.
"Elowen, how far now to the Mucklestones?" asked
the dark haired woman in wizardly attire. "Though I've
journeyed there several times, this will be the first time
I've done so by taking every jarring step in between."
The dark haired woman sighed, rubbing the small of
her back.
Marrec swung down from his horse. He studied the
forest floor. He was acquainted with many forests in the
west, but he was unfamiliar with that one.
He asked Elowen, "Anything we should watch out for,
aside from rotting volodnis?"
Elowen said, "Certainly. This is a wild forest, and dan-
gerous creatures roam below its dark canopy. Of course,
most are goodly creatures that bear us no ill will. If we're
lucky, we might meet a treant. I know a few in this part
of Lethyr."
"Treants?" asked Gunggari. Gunggari was clothed
more in tattoos than cloth, and the chill rain threatened
to raise goosebumps on his skin. He took advantage of the
pause to dismount.
"Great stewards of the forest. Nentyar hunters like
myself sometimes work hand in hand with these great
treeish creatures to protect the woods from threat."
"I hope their 'treeishness' doesn't make them suscep-
tible to the same sort of controlling rot as the volodnis
we've faced," commented Marrec.
He walked over to Ash on her pony, checking her sad-
dle. The horse and child had weathered the trip amazingly
well, without soreness, hurt, or abraded skin. He suspected
the girl's healing ability had been at work. Reminded of
that, he mentally sought out his own remaining powers as
a tongue seeks the space formerly occupied by a recently
pulled tooth. His powers had diminished, and without
64.THE PRIESTS

--- Page 73 ---
contact with Lurue, he couldn't replace the powers he
used up. During their trip across the plain, his feeling
of connection with Lurue had grown more tenuous than
ever. He prayed for the thousandth time that he was on the
right path, and that the girl held the answer to Lurue's
silence.
Marrec toweled the girl's hair dry with the hem of his
cloak. The child briefly fixed him with her dull gaze.
"Ash," she commented.
Elowen walked back to join him, as did Gunggari.
Ususi on her horse was already close. They had an im-
promptu conference beneath the weepy canopy.
The elf hunter said, "I've brought us in just to the
south of a human settlement on the forest edge. I think
we're far enough from their loggers," she sniffed. "Like-
wise, all the wood elves who inhabit Lethyr are clustered
further to the west and south of here, so we'll likely avoid
having to explain our presence to them. Really, it's a
straight shot through the trees."
"How far?" repeated Ususi, a somewhat testy tone to
her voice.
"With a clear route and no trouble, it'd be no more than
a day's travel, but of course wending through the trees
will slow us. I estimate we'll reach the Mucklestones
tomorrow evening."
Ususi shook her head and said, "Not soon enough for
me. Even one more night of 'camping' is more than I can
handle."
Gunggari grinned at the mage's words but said noth-
ing. Marrec forbade comment, too, realizing that for the
city woman, stone-like skin or not, their trip must have
been hard to endure.
"What?" Gunggari snapped, stepping back and looking
intently up into the leafy foliage ahead and above them.
The Oslander had pulled out his dizheri just as quickly.
The others all reacted with alarm, peering ahead and
grabbing up their
weapons.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 65

--- Page 74 ---
"What's going on?" demanded Ususi.
Marrec strained his eyes but saw nothing unusual
amidst the dripping leaves. It was midmorning, but the
light, already filtered by lowering clouds, was further
reduced under the trees.
"Gunny, what is it? I don't see anything."
"It's gone now, Marrec," responded the tattooed war-
rior, still looking forward intently, "but something was
watching us--some sort of ape."
"There are no apes in Lethyr," pronounced Elowen.
"It wasn't exactly an ape," continued Gunggari. "At
first I thought a man's face was staring at me, but then I
saw that gray-white hair covered its twisted limbs, and
it had more than just two eyes-many more than I could
count in the heartbeat it appeared to me."
Elowen frowned.
"Uthraki?" she murmured, almost under her breath.
"What's an uthraki?" wondered Marrec.
"A nasty beast native to Rashemen. I have never heard
of one so far west. They are confined to Rashemen and
further east-or they were."
"Anything we should know about these uthraki?"
asked Marrec.
"Yes. They can assume forms other than their own."
Gunggari narrowed his eyes, and gripped his war club
all the tighter.
All variety of trees were contained within Lethyr,
Marrec realized: maples, firs, aspens, pines, holly, oaks,
tulip-trees, crabapples, and many more that the cleric
could not name, despite his familiarity with forests to the
west. Of wildlife, they heard and saw many birds, a fox
chasing a rabbit, more squirrels than could be numbered,
a sleepy owl, and once, far off, the yip of a wolf.
A full day of travel under the dark boughs saw light
66. THE PRIESTS

--- Page 75 ---
give way to nearly complete twilight. The white trunks
of the aspen grove through which they currently wended
glowed all the paler for the growing dimness of the sur-
rounding pines. The green leaves glimmered and shook
in a sudden breeze of colder air. Night was coming on,
and the sounds of the forest began to change, as some
creatures sought their lairs, and others, stretching, be-
gan their nightly rounds. At the urging of the wind, the
rustling forest leaves sounded their nightly chorus.
Elowen walked at the head of the group, leading her
mount. The elf finally paused and smiled, saying, "Ah ha.
I knew there was a waycache around here. Come on, fol-
low me."
The elf hunter dropped the reigns of her horse, moved
along the side of a massive boulder that was butted up
against a cliff, then dipped around behind it out of sight.
Marrec shrugged and dismounted. Before hobbling
his own horse for the night, he helped down Ususi. Ususi
plucked Ash from her pony then moved to follow Elowen,
leaving Marrec with the job of grooming, feeding, and
hobbling the horses.
"They know the silent art of delegation," noted Gung-
gari, as the Oslander helped Marrec take care of all their
mounts' needs.
Marrec grinned but added, "You have to admit, there
is something about the mage..."
"
"My people ask if beauty at a steep price is still beauty,
Marrec."
The unicorn warrior laughed, saying, "Don't worry,
Gunny. I've got enough on my plate with just the two
women in my life, Lurue and Ash. I don't want to add a
third to the mix.*
Despite his pronouncement, he knew himself well
enough to realize the damage had already been done. He
found Ususi exotic. Damn.
"What about you, though?" Marrec quizzed his friend.
"I notice you have been treating Elowen to far more
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 67

--- Page 76 ---
stories of 'your land' than I've heard from your mouth in
a year. Something tells me you're showing off."
Gunggari cocked his head without responding and
finished grooming Henri.
When the two men finished, they passed through the
cleft formed by boulder and cliff and found a small hollow
cunningly cut into the cliff wall. The space was far larger
than Marrec would have supposed from the outside. He
guessed he might be able to get the mounts into the space,
though that might be pushing it. Elowen had hung her
lamp on an overhanging branch, washing everything in
dim radiance.
Several cavities, like inset shelves, were cut into the
rock of the surrounding boulders. Elowen went through
these shelves as Marrec watched, pulling out small leaf
wrapped packets. Ususi sat on a small moss-lined boul-
der, her nose in one of the books she had brought. Ash sat
nearby, looking nowhere in particular. On the far side of
the waycache, water from a spring spilled into a carved
basin, then drained again from one side into a small
ravine that slipped back under the earth. Marrec used
and even maintained similar caches for travelers in the
woods of Cormanthor and even in the High Forest, but he
had to admit that the hidden spring was a nice touch.
"I don't understand," said Elowen, still going through
the contents of the shelves. "This waycache hasn't been
restocked in at least a year by the looks of these." She
gestured to the few leaf-wrapped parcels she had drawn
out. The leaves were dried and brown, which Marrec
knew spoke volumes about the freshness of whatever was
contained within.
Ash stood without prodding, which was unusual,
walked over and nudged one of the wrappers. The girl's
nose wrinkled, as if in disgust.
"What is it?" said Marrec, rushing up to his charge.
Losing interest, Ash lapsed back into her normal un-
caring stare.

--- Page 77 ---
"She must sense the spoilage," responded Elowen.
"We're stuck with our own rations for a few more nights,
it seems. I can't understand why this cache hasn't been
restocked. Briartan never allows this portion of the wood
to go untended."
Gunggari asked, "How close are we to the Muckle-
stones from here?"
"Just a few miles," answered Elowen. "I thought this
would be a good place to rest up before plunging ahead. I
want us to be rested when we meet the great druid."
Ususi looked up. She said, "Briartan has the Muck-
lestones in his charge. The Mucklestones are blocked. I
doubt Briartan would have allowed that if he could have
stopped it. Since he couldn't stop it, he's probably..."
Elowen stared at her friend with dawning alarm in her
eyes, and Ususi didn't finish her thread of logic. Marrec
was gratified to see that Ususi had empathy enough to
spare her friend's feelings. It gave him hope.
The group bedded down for the night after establish-
ing a watch schedule. Marrec went to his rest, thankful to
have avoided first watch, but sleep was too brief. He woke
to the relentless black of middle-night at Gunggari's
prodding, whose turn it was to cast off into dreamland.
He held back an irritated comment with a real show of
will. Where lack of sleep was involved, the cleric knew he
was sometimes bitter.
Marrec was on the middle-watch, when by rights all
earthly creatures should be snug in their dens-except
for the worst sort of creature, which, after all, was why
he was awake to guard against them. His eyes roamed
the waycache, picking out each of his fellow travelers
wrapped snuggly in their blankets. They'd had a small
fire earlier, but Gunggari had let it die down to mere
embers. Marrec lit the lamp. Elowen had found a store of
lamp oil in one of the storage shelves, more than enough
to last through several days of continuous burning
should they need it.

The sound of a child crying dimly reached his ears.
stiffened, his eyes immediately shifting to Ash, but the
girl slept soundly, her eyes and mouth closed. He could
still hear the crying, unmistakably that of small child.
Was it his curse to find orphans around every corner?
Better check it out, he chided himself.
Before he exited, he shook the tattooed warrior, "Gun-
ny, you awake?"
The Oslander opened one eye and used it to fix him
with a baleful stare.
Marrec whispered, "I'm going out to check something.
I heard some kid crying out in the woods, just outside
the waycache. Stay alert, I'll be back in a minute if it's
nothing."
Gunggari craned his head, listening, but the crying
had stopped.
Marrec held the lamp up in one hand, held his spear
Justlance in the other, and exited the cozy waycache into
the darkness of the forest.
Pausing some feet beyond the large boulder, he
scanned to the extent he was able, listening with all his
attention. He heard a quiet sob off to the right.
He moved toward the sound, cautious and ready for a
trap. What he found was an elven boy of not more than
thirteen years, cringing from Marrec's lamplight, hiding
behind a great tree. He was dirty and his clothing was
ripped. The boy's eyes were wide with fear.
"What in Lurue's great wilderness are you doing
here?" asked Marrec.
The boy looked at him, then said something in a lan-
guage Marrec didn't know. Elvish, but strangely accented.
Looking around, the cleric couldn't find any other
evidence to explain how an elven boy could be hiding and
crying outside the waycache.
"All right, let's get you back to the others. Elowen will
know where you come from, I wager."
Sheathing his spear, he then held out a hand for the
.

boy to take. "Come on, I'm not going to hurt you."
The boy took Marrec's hand and allowed himself to be
lad into the waycache.
The waif's eyes were wide as he took in the group,
most still sleeping, except for Gunggari and Elowen.
Gunggari must have woken Elowen while Marrec was
outside the hollow, he thought. Good, then he didn't have
to be the one...
"What are you doing?" yelled Elowen at Marrec.
As she yelled, she struggled for her weapon, which was
snagged in her sleeping furs.
Taken off guard, Marrec stared dumbly. That's when
the elven boy gave voice to a horrible roar and leaped
through the air toward Ash.
In a timeless instant, Marrec saw the boy bloat and
elongate, his boy-shape melting away to reveal a gray-
white hairy apelike thing. Its twisted limbs scrabbled
through the air as they unfolded, and a dozen completely
black eyes set all the way around its head glared in all
directions.
Gunggari, closer to Ash than anyone else, managed
to throw himself into the path of the creature, but the
creature that smashed into the Oslander was at least four
times the mass of a man. It bowled Gunggari over, send-
ing man and dizheri flying.
Gunggari had offered enough distraction for Mar-
rec to react, but he was too far from the beast. Marrec
had sheathed his spear, and his goddess-granted spells
seemed as distant as ever. He felt an unwelcome heat
behind his eyes, as if in answer to his frustration.
Elowen, bringing up her sword, hissed, "An uthraki!"
The uthraki, its path clear, focused its attention on
the just-waking Ash. Its eight foot height towered over
the child. Marree's eyes began to burn. He felt the ache
form a searing circuit from the back of his head to his
eyes, and...
As if reaching up to pluck a fruit from a tree, Ash
BRUCE R. CORDELL 71
.

--- Page 80 ---
touched the advancing creature. A dim flash ... and
where once stood the uthraki, there was nothing, save
perhaps motes of dust glittering in Marrec's lamplight.
Silence descended on the hollow, as all eyes fell on
little Ash. The girl seemed oblivious to the attention. She
settled back into her furs.
Marree released his pent-up breath, and with it the
pain in his head dispersed, just as quickly. His oath re-
mained intact. He gave silent thanks to Lurue, but the
girl... what powers did she yet hide? No wonder she was
so important to the goddess.
"She has more than just the hands of a healer," com-
mented Gunggari, saying aloud what all must were
thinking.
Ususi, who had woken late but in time to note Ash's
spectacular destruction of the threatening beast, said
nothing, but she watched the young girl closely.
Elowen said, "It is odd that the uthraki was so intent
on Ash. Usually, they attack those they've duped, after
they've led their intended victim into a secluded spot."
Marrec realized that Elowen meant that it should
have been Marrec who was attacked, while he was out-
side the hollow. Perhaps she was even rebuking him for
falling victim to such a dupe. He felt the urge to defend
his choice to investigate the sound of a crying child-but
instead, he quietly accepted the blame.
The figure stepped forward, entering the stone circle
while darkness yet reigned. One of his spies had perished.
The spell that linked him to the shapechanger was
severed. He cared not for the welfare of the uthraki-it
was little more than a beast. It had served its purpose
merely in giving warning through its death. Someone
approached.
72
Gameliel woke his thralls. There were preparations
THE PRIESTS

--- Page 81 ---
to make, rot to culture, and spells to unsheathe. He
wouldn't allow the newest, most important outpost of the
Rotting Man's empire to fall back into the idle hands of
idiot druids. He glanced at the dark shape that still hung
impaled on one of the great stones, smirking.
The blightlord felt the weight of the Keystone's cord
around his neck. With it, Gameliel possessed the power
of the Mucklestones. There was no place the Rotting Man
and his most powerful servants could not penetrate at
whim.
First, he had to prepare the ambush.

THE
RIESTS
CHAPTER 9
When
hen darkness failed, they broke camp.
Marrec thought the woods were too quiet. In
forests to the west, he would have been able to
identify the calls of over a dozen species of birds
in as many seconds. Instead one crow cawed in
the distance as they set out that morning, and for
the next several hours he heard nothing more.
"Is the forest usually so..." began Marrec.
"Silent?" finished Elowen. "No." She frowned.
"Even yesterday, if you recall, all seemed well.
Something's changed."
"It's Gameliel," spoke Ususi from behind them.
She continued, "His influence may extend beyond
the Mucklestones, and we are close to the circle. I
begin to feel the stone shapes in my mind."
"If we are close, we need to be cautious," ad-
vised Gunggari, who rode abreast of Marrec and
Elowen.

--- Page 83 ---
"Agreed," nodded the elf hunter. She added in a tenta-
tive tone, "I worry about Briartan."
Marrec said nothing. If Briartan were responsible for
the Mucklestones, he doubted the man had come to any
good with Gameliel's arrival, or worse, Briartan had been
co-opted. He'd seen similar things in the past. They'd find
out what was really going on in just a few miles.
He said, "We need a plan, of course."
Gunggari smiled and waited.
"First, let's hear more about this Gameliel," said
Marrec. "What should we be prepared for? What does it
mean when you say he is a blightlord?"
"The blightlords serve the goddess called Talona," said
Elowen. "They are corrupt priests who revel in rot and
decay. Their plagues and blights have transformed the
western reaches of the Rawlinswood into a foul green hell
of diseased monsters and deadly poisons. Gameliel is but
one of three, that we know of. Always they seek to infect
the healthy forests and lands nearby with the same sick-
ness that is rapidly destroying the ancient Rawlinswood.
Though they ultimately serve Talona, their direct mas-
ter is the Rotting Man, the one who stands highest in
Talona's putrid grace."
"What're the other two called again?" wondered Marrec.
"Anammelech and Damanda."
All were quiet for a moment, absorbing Elowen's words.
Marrec finally said, "Gunggari should sneak ahead
and scout when we get a little closer, then report back.
He's good at that sort of thing."
"I'm going with him," stated Elowen. "I also know a
thing or two about forest craft."
"Great," said Marrec. "We'll proceed at a slower pace.
Double back when you have the chance. Give a signal if
you need help."
"What signal?" wondered Elowen.
"If I can not reach my dizheri, I will yell for help," said
Gunggari.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 75

--- Page 84 ---
Elowen smiled. She and Gunggari dismounted, then
forged ahead, melting into the greenery.
They moved through the forest. Like leaves on a
breeze, from the shadow of one tree to the next, Elowen
and Gunggari closed on their goal.
Elowen called upon her stealthcraft, gratified to see
that Gunggari knew at least as much as she. To many
of her race, surreptitious forest travel came naturally.
Elowen liked to keep her techniques in the forefront of
her mind. She felt that by doing so, she was all the better
at evading detection.
For instance, movement itself is a target indicator.
The eye is drawn to movements, so a stationary target
may be impossible to detect, and even a steadily but
slowly moving target might go unnoticed. Quick, jerky
movements are almost always seen, so her slow but silky
movements from bole to trunk were deliberate. She didn't
give herself away by talking to Gunggari. Of course, she
always stowed her equipment in a way that eliminated
chance rattling.
Both she and the Oslander were already dressed ap-
propriately for such movement. Neither openly carried
anything reflective. Both wore colors designed to blend
into the foliage in an attempt to obscure their silhouettes.
A body's outline, or even just the head and shoulders, are
silhouettes that draw an intelligent eye; even if a watcher
can't identify what it sees immediately, the eye is uncon-
sciously drawn, and recognition eventually percolates
into consciousness. Camouflage helped.
The trees ahead of her were obviously not right. She
held her right hand up and made a fist, a sign for Gung-
gari to pause. Taking a moment, she scanned the area,
noticing the blighted trees and a gray, unhealthy looking
fungus growing over trees, leaves-though there were few
76 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 85 ---
enough of those-and the ground. Beyond those she could
make out a clear circular space bordered by weathered
stones. She was seeing the edge of the Mucklestones.
Normally, the ring of trees surrounding the stones
reached their branches out above the hollow bowl, entirely
protecting it from the sky's open gaze. But the surround-
ing trees, fungus-wounded and dying, had lost most of
their leaves, and the sky was easily visible above.
Just as the nearby trees were host to the life-sapping
fungus, the very stones that gave the place their name
were scarred with innumerable patches of growth, stain-
ing them with gray slime and obscuring the nature runes
etched into the stone.
There, too, was Briartan. Elowen gave out a gasp before
she could rein in her reaction. Her old friend was staked
to one of the Mucklestones, spread-eagle, an iron spike
driven through the palms of both hands. His head lolled
down on his chest, and he didn't move. His left leg was
missing, amputated. Blood stains spattered his clothing.
"Briartan!" whispered Elowen, unable to stop herself.
Something else moved within the bowl. Many some-
things, but from her current position, the recessed nature
of the bowl hid what moved, or how many potential foes
lurked within.
Defiant, Elowen moved. She motioned for Gunggari to
accompany her but didn't wait to see what action the Os-
lander would take. All her attention was on Briartan. She
needed to see if he was still alive, despite his awful state.
Defying her stealthcraft, she darted up to Briartan.
The druid was staked up on an exterior face of one of the
great stones. She reached up and felt for a pulse on the
man's neck. A slight staccato beat, but it was, oh, so faint.
"We've been spotted," hissed Gunggari.
She glanced into the bowl. Gunggari was right.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 77

--- Page 86 ---
Marree didn't know what to do with Ash, he realized too
late. He debated leaving her back with Ususi, but accord-
ing to Elowen, the woman was a skilled mage, and they
could use her talents against the Blightlord, if indeed
Gameliel was found in the center of the Mucklestones.
Besides, he doubted Ususi would hang back-she was out
for Gameliel's blood.
Gunggari's dizheri blared forth, penetrating clearly
even through the thick forest growth. It was a call for
aid.
Marrec realized the time for worrying was over. He
whipped Henri's lead around the bole of the nearest tree
and tied it with a loose knot. He had tied Elowen and
Gunggari's horses on the same bole when they had de-
parted. Ash sat her mount without comment.
He fixed the girl with a look and said, "Ash, stay here.
We'll be back. You'll be all right."
The girl looked at him, unconcerned. Now that he had
seen her defend herself against the uthraki, some of the
anxiety he felt about escorting such a small child into
danger was reduced.
Ususi used the time Marrec was dealing with Ash to
charge ahead on her horse, heading toward the dizheri's
call. Marrec cursed and spurred his own horse in pursuit.
Marrec goaded his steed to the maximum pace it was
willing to take through the forest, which was too fast
for his own comfort, he realized only after the fact. Tree
trunks and low branches whizzed by, and a jump over a
fallen log almost sent him tumbling off the back of the
horse. The retreating, snaking hem of Ususi's cloak led
him on, elusively remaining just out of reach.
Then everything opened up, as he flashed past two
standing stones, one on either side, and into a wide circle
bounded by rune-etched obelisks. At the last, Ususi held
back, allowing Marrec to charge into the bowl by himself.
He cursed again when he saw what was waiting.
At least ten gangrenous rot fiends occupied the
78. THE PRIESTS

--- Page 87 ---
outskirts of the bowl, concentrated to Marrec's left; he saw
they were engaging Gunggari and Elowen. His attention
was consumed by the man who stood at the center of the
ring at its deepest point. It was Gameliel. It had to be.
The blightlord wore dark gray plate armor, etched
with runes that appeared to pulsate and overlap each
other occasionally, and from which seeped an oily, black
fluid. He wore reddish gauntlets and a helm constructed
of the same blood-hued alloy. In one hand he seemed to
clutch a halberd-shaped hole in the air leading into utter
blackness. Marrec felt he could feel cold bleeding from
it, even from where he heeled his mount to stand several
yards away.
Gameliel the blightlord stood in a puddle of ooze that
was constantly being replenished from the blightlord's
armor. Small tendrils of ooze snaked up away from the
shallow pool at the bowl's center, touching many of the
flat stones ringing the space.
"You picked the wrong day to visit the Mucklestones,
friend," came the blightlord's rasping voice.
"You picked..."
Interrupting Marrec's witty response came Ususi's
strident yell, "You've contaminated the portal system.
You've wrecked the stones!"
She had to shout over the clamor of fighting between
the volodnis, Elowen, and Gunggari. Marrec could barely
see either the elf hunter or the Oslander. Their fight
continued outside the ring and was screened from the
cleric's view by the press of rot fiends, but he could hear
Gunggari's dizheri singing to itself as the tattooed soldier
swung it against the swarming volodnis.
"On the contrary," rasped Gameliel. "I haven't wrecked
them. I've re-routed the stones for my own use."
Marrec, in turn, interrupted Ususi, "Call your rot
fiends off and yield, or we'll force you to succumb. If you
yield willingly and answer my questions about the god-
dess Lurue..."
BRUCE R. CORDELL - 79

--- Page 88 ---
Ususi struck, interrupting his ultimatum. A rush of
unintelligible words preceded her throwing motion. A
bead of fire arced high over bowl then dropped toward the
blightlord. Marrec sighed. He'd have to get his answers
the hard way.
Gameliel glanced at the falling bead but was unruf-
fled. Instead, he spewed a foul syllable. Even as Ususi's
fiery bead fell toward him, the oily sludge in which he
stood inflated, as if it was a mammoth bubble of swamp
gas on the surface of stagnant water. In a mere second it
enclosed Gameliel in a transparent dome. The blightlord
stood within, gesticulating and chanting.
The bead of fire detonated directly over the blight-
lord's head. The rush of heat singed Marrec's eyebrows,
but when the flash faded, Gameliel was unharmed. The
bubble was gone, and there was less ooze at the blight-
lord's feet than before.
From the back of his horse, Marrec hurled Justlance
at the blightlord. It sped unerringly at Gameliel, but a
tendril of ooze rose up and flicked the spear away. Instead
of the blightlord's chest, it buried itself in a rune-etched
stone, its shaft quivering.
Gameliel finished incanting. A flash of dark green
heralded the sudden appearance of a monster no more
than arm's length from Ususi. The powerfully built
creature stood taller than Ususi on her mount. She
yelled in alarm and shrank back on her saddle. Marrec
recognized the monster-a forest troll, and a big one at
that.
Already Gameliel was chanting away on another spell.
Marrec knew a troll so close would challenge Ususi's abil-
ity to defend herself, but the cleric judged that he had to
deal with the blightlord first, or they might face even
more trolls.
Time to use up another hoarded spell, Marrec decided.
The slime shield had to be burned away.
He called on what grace was left to him, channeling a
80 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 89 ---
searing beam of divine light, which he hurled as a spear
at Gameliel's heart.
Again the slime bubble rose up and absorbed the blast,
or at least part of it. This time, a trickle of light played
across the blightlord's form. Gameliel cried out then
cursed as he lost the weave of his spell.
The volodnis continued their attack on Gunggari and
Elowen across a quarter span of the Mucklestones bowl,
not Marrec's concern right then.
What about... soot and coal!
His glance back revealed Ususi squirming in the
troll's grasp. With both hands clamped upon the wizard,
the troll was attempting to pull her into two pieces.
Just lance appeared once more in Marrec's hand, and in
a single liquid movement he cast the spear directly into
the troll's back.
The green behemoth screamed, dropping Ususi. The
woman scuttled backward on all fours, bloodied but
still alive. The troll whirled, searching for its attacker
an instant before fixing its hungry gaze on Marrec. It
charged, its powerful arms raised high, its claws promis-
ing a lethal rain. Marree spurred his horse, tried to get
it to sidestep the charging monster, but his mount reared
in a sudden panic, throwing the cleric to the ground. The
fall jolted the wind from him.
"Whose plan was this, anyway?" Marrec muttered as
he attempted to regain his feet, only to be bowled over by
the troll. Its claws sought crevices in his armor but were
only partially successful. A thread of pain pulsed on the
side of Marrec's face where one of the troll's claws scored.
Again, Justlance shimmered back to his hand, giving
the troll a moment's pause. Armed again, his confidence
ticked back up a notch. He used the spear's shaft to quick-
ly lever himself to his feet. The sour, rotten smell of the
troll's breath rolled over him, nearly a presence in and of
itself, hardly less lethal than the monster.
Marrec groaned as he felt something touch him from
BRUCE R. CORDELL 81

--- Page 90 ---
behind through his armor. The blightlord, untended,
had gotten another nasty hex off, and he was the target.
Whatever it was, it seemed to be growing below his armor
second by second. It itched as if a colony of ants were run-
ning across his back. He yelped in surprise, or if truth be
told, alarm.
A crack of thunder rode the heels of a crazy line of
electric light that zagged past Marrec and struck Game-
liel a grazing shot. Ususi was on her feet again, but her
aim was a little off. The blightlord snarled with pain
but dramatically clutched his empty fist, as if squeezing
something. In response, pain blistered across Marrec's
body. The pain issued from the spot he'd seconds before
felt the itching. As if pain were sprouting roots across his
body, the agony grew.
Marrec realized he had been infected with the blight-
lord's touch. Some sort of hyper-quick rot or disease, he
presumed. He fumbled in his belt pouch and brought out
a small vial filled with fizzing blue-white liquid. Though
his directly granted spells were nearly spent, he was not
without one or two additional resources. Uncorking the
vial with his teeth, he gulped down its contents. The
divine balm spread through him like cool water, quench-
ing the pain and driving the infection from his body. He
gasped out thanks to Lurue.
The troll took advantage of Marrec's distraction with
another claw-tipped swing, forcing him back behind
the point of his spear. He risked another glance at the
blightlord. Gameliel spent another second clutching the
air before realizing the action was futile. Marrec's brief
infection was cleansed.
Gameliel said, "You seem resistant to the lesser rots.
Let's see how you fare against the Corruption of..."
He broke off when he saw the pale green beam of light
touch dead center upon his chest. The beam was projected
by Ususi, still standing just outside the ring of the bowl.
"Is that...?" was Gameliel's last utterance.
82. THE PRIESTS

--- Page 91 ---
The blightlord burst asunder. The pool of slime began to
boil then wisped away like morning fog. The black halberd
he had been clutching in one hand continued to stand of its
own accord for a moment then slowly dissipated, like a hole
in mud closing over, leaving nothing but empty air.
Residual power snapped and discharged from Ususi's
pointing hand. In her other hand she held an unrolled
page of vellum, penned sigils still fading from its surface.
She had unleashed a spell penned by the hand of a mighty
wizard. Marrec wondered if that hand was Ususi's?
The wizard winced, shaking her hand free of residual
power, and said, "You shouldn't have disturbed the Muck-
lestones, blightlord," then fell back against a stone.
Her effort must have been extreme-the spell on the
parchment may have been beyond her normal ability
to cast. Smoke rose from her garments. The scroll, its
potency spent, fluttered to the ground, now completely
blank vellum. Ususi managed to retain her feet with the
help of the supporting obelisk.
"Lurue's blessing..." Marrec's claim of victory was cut
off by the troll's vicious attack. Whatever power Game-
liel had used to call the monster, it survived its master's
death.
He deflected one of the creature's claw-tipped swings
with Justlance, running a deep score along the troll's arm
with his spear tip. Even as Marrec watched, the rubbery
flesh closed up where he'd torn it. Recollection trickled
into his mind: The best way to put a troll down for good
was with fire.
Marrec yelled, "Burn it!" and swung the shaft of his
spear low along the ground, surprising the troll; it has
been expecting another stab. It stumbled over the shaft
and fell on its face, a victim of Marrec's trip.
The unicorn warrior turned tail and retreated, even
as the troll pushed itself upright with its preternaturally
long arms. Still, he put a little space between himself and
the beast, just enough, he hoped.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 83

--- Page 92 ---
Seizing her opportunity despite her exhaustion, Ususi
skipped another bead of flame down the bowl. The troll
attempted to evade, but the pellet bounced once, twice,
and at the summit of its third skip, exploded into a sphere
of raging flame. The troll was enveloped. When the fire
faded into sizzling wisps a heartbeat later, the monster
survived only as a flaming remnant that sent up a pillar
of black smoke.
The stench wrinkled Marrec's nose. He grinned none-
theless, but the sound of the dizheri, as it bashed and
battered against the flesh of blighted volodnis, was yet
audible. Apparently the corrupted forest folk, like the
troll, were unconcerned that their master was no more,
but only a few remained standing. Gunggari and Elowen
then appeared on perimeter of the Mucklestones, fight-
ing their way into the bowl. A final few thrusts with
Elowen's sword, a wild swing with Gunggari's warclub,
and finally some unlooked for assistance by Marrec from
behind ended the threat for good.
Nothing stirred in the bowl. Marrec's blood cooled. He
stowed Justlance.

CHAPTER 10
They pulled Briartan down from his cruel shackles.
Marrec thought life had fled, but after feeling
for a pulse, he detected a faint beat. He wondered
if the time had come to use the last few healing
spells he'd been saving up for a dire circumstance.
Briartan was the only one around who could an-
swer his questions. He glanced at Ash-the girl
studied the supine form, but she made no move to
use her healing gift. It was up to him then.
He mouthed the words of healing and touched
the wounded druid's forehead. The glowing blue
threads of healing power rippled from Marrec's
arm and wound into Briartan's body. Marrec could
feel torn tissues knitting and depleted stores of
energy rebounding, but he also immediately real-
ized the truth. Briartan's spirit was wounded to
the core. The druid sought only release.
Marrec fought with Briartan's desire. They

--- Page 94 ---
battled to a temporary compromise. It was the best Mar-
rec could accomplish. He had but one spell of healing
remaining. He knew he must choose wisely when and
how he would use it.
Briartan's eyes fluttered open.
Elowen grabbed the fallen man's hand. "You're going
to be all right, Briartan."
Marrec quietly shook his hood, but Elowen didn't see.
The wounded druid responded, "Elowen. I'm afraid I
can't stay much longer. I've glimpsed higher realms and
the promise of infinite plains of green..."
39
Elowen squeezed the druid's hand "The world needs
you here, Briartan. The blightlord is defeated. Stay with
us, won't you?"
The druid found the elf's eyes as she leaned over his
prostrate form. He said softly, "I will answer your ques-
tions, that you may have some aid of me, but more than
that I cannot promise."
Elowen stifled a gasp, looking for confirmation from
Marrec and found it in the cleric's sad nod. The elf's eyes
began to shimmer with retained tears. She squeezed
Briartan's hand all the tighter.
Marrec began to phrase his questions internally, but
Ususi moved in, undeterred by Marrec's need or Briar-
tan's fragile state.
She said, "What did Gameliel want here? How did he
overcome your defenses of the Mucklestones?"
Briartan gave a weak chuckle. "Ususi, I knew I'd see
you before the end. Too bad you couldn't have arrived
earlier. What does anyone want with the Mucklestones?
Control. The kind of control one might gain if he had
quick access to all corners of Faerûn." Briartan ended
with a cough.
"How did Gameliel overcome you?" repeated Ususi.
"Why, he surprised me. He sent the sickened pine folk
to me. I thought they were seeking a cure. I labored for
days on reversing the rot which afflicted them, before I
86
..
THE PRIESTS

--- Page 95 ---
realized the truth; they would never be cured. What I
didn't realize was that their sickness was aimed like an
arrow at me and my hospitality. By letting them breach
the circle, I also allowed in Gameliel. He overcame me
and wrested from me control over the Keystone."
Ususi started, then rose from her haunches. She moved
toward where Gameliel had last stood.
"Briartan?" Elowen breathed. "Are you in too much
pain?"
The druid turned his head so that his gaze could rest
more easily on the hunter. "Ah, Elowen, don't be sad. I am
so glad that you are here, that you are here to see me off.
Please, explain my fate to the Nentyarch who sits-in-exile
in Yeshelmaar. The Nentyarch must know what has hap-
pened here."
"Yeshelmaar?" she blurted.
"You've been away from the fold for quite some time,
then, Elowen?" ventured Briartan. He continued, "Yes,
seek both the Council of Lethyr and the Nentyarch in
Yeshelmaar. Bring him the Keystone."
Marrec wanted to ask his own questions, but Elowen
needed a moment with her friend. He glanced up to see
what Ususi was doing. The mage was crouched, studying
the scattered debris of the blightlord's possessions.
Elowen, trying to keep the druid engaged, said, "I'd
hoped that the Nentyarch was still in the Rawlinswood.
If he's taken a seat in Yeshelmaar, it must mean the
Rotting Man was too strong for even the Nentyarch.
When I left on my mission, Yeshelmaar was being pre-
pared as a possible seat-in-exile. I hoped it would not
come to pass." She bit her lip then asked, "Briartan, was
Gameliel acting as an emissary of the Rotting Man?"
"You know he was, and he is but the least of the
blightlords who give their allegiance to the Talontyr.
Anammelech's unnatural tread causes the forest to
shiver, and Damanda is nearly a power in her own right,
yet she has the ear of the Rotting Man." The conversation
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 87

--- Page 96 ---
was fast sapping the druid's last reserves of strength.
Briartan's eyes began to stray upward, attempting to
focus on vistas invisible to the living.
"Briartan," Marrec jumped in, realizing the druid was
close to departing, "I have traveled far seeking answers.
The goddess Lurue, who you may know, is losing contact
with many of her servants, me included. My quest is to
renew that connection. My quest has led me first to this
strange child, who we call Ash, and also the Child of Light,
and now to you. It seems that, for reasons I don't under-
stand the Rotting Man wants the girl. More than that, I
need to know who this girl is, and why she is important to
Lurue. Do you have any answers for me, great druid?"
Briartan considered Marrec's speech a moment before
responding. Then he said, "I know of Lurue, the Unicorn
Queen. She may have quieted her connection to you, but
if she has, it is most assuredly for a good reason. It is
strange, though-I do not sense that all connections of
the Unicorn Queen and the world have weakened as yours
has. You must seek the Nentyarch for your answers-he
has time I lack." Briartan paused, straining to gather
more breath. His color, briefly renewed by Marrec's craft,
was failing once more.
Ash wandered up of her own accord and fixed the dying
druid with her guileless stare.
Seeing her, Briartan's eyes widened. "This is the child?"
Marrec nodded.
Briartan made a reverent sign with a shaking hand.
He said, "Yes, she is special; I can see that with even my
failing eyes. Keep her safe, unicorn warrior. One day, this
Child of Light will answer to the Rotting Man's depreda-
tions." He broke into a fit of coughing. The druid's time
was drawing to a close.
Briartan's cough subsided. He fixed his gaze straight
up. At last he whispered, "The cycle of life may not be
denied. Death gives way to life, and life..."
88
The druid's gaze remained fixed even as his breath
THE PRIESTS

--- Page 97 ---
whispered away, rising in to penetrate the boughs and
branches that hid the clearing from the sky above. Never
more would the wisdom of the druid of Lethyr grace the
forests.
Marrec closed Briartan's eyes. A tear traced a path
from Elowen's full eyes down her cheek. She spoke then
in the language of the elves.
Though Marrec knew only a few fragments of the
sylvan tongue, it seemed that Elowen was asking for
blessings and aid to Briartan's spirit from a series of
elven deities and great spirits of the forest.
When she finished, Elowen stood. She said simply, "He
will be missed," then walked to the edge of the clearing,
seeking solace in the uncontaminated growth beyond the
stone circle.
Later, they laid Briartan to rest according to the rites
of elves and druids. When finished with that solemn duty,
the five rested in the bowl of the Mucklestones. Already
the rot and crusted growths that had overtaken the stone
circle were receding. The power of the stones was greater
than that of the Rotting Man, at least without one of his
blightlord emissaries present.
Gunggari had offered condolences to Elowen earlier,
but the wisdom of Osse was apparently too gruff for the
elven palate. Elowen continued to sit, facing away from
the rest of the group, staring into the trees.
Ususi spoke up, after a long silence. "Briartan was my
friend, too, in his own way. He allowed me my researches.
I will continue in your company, if you'll have me." She
looked up, meeting Marrec's eye.
Marrec raised an eyebrow. "I thought you'd go back to
Two Stars. The Mucklestones are clear."
"If I'm not welcome, then Two Stars is where I'll go, of
course," responded Ususi.

"Don't misunderstand me; there is nothing I'd like
better than your aid," said Marrec, trying to keep his
voice from sounding testy. "I've rarely seen your skill
with wizardry equaled. Plus, we enjoy your company."
Out of sight of Ususi, the Oslander cocked his head.
Marrec read it as a sign of amusement.
"Good!" exclaimed Ususi, smiling, which was an event
in and of itself. "Then I have good news. I can get us to
Yeshelmaar quickly over the course of a single march."
Elowen finally broke her silence, saying "Via the
Mucklestones?"
Ususi nodded, "I can reroute one of the main portal
lines from here to there. With the Keystone, once in the
keeping of Briartan, I can do it with little effort." The
woman produced a polished, amber colored stone with a
natural looking hole piercing its center. The stone was
strung on a leather thong. As Ususi handled it, the stone
brightened, giving off a glow all its own.
Elowen gave Ususi an appraising look.
Ususi said, "I know, Elowen. I know. The Keystone
shall go back to the keeping of the Nentyarch, but we
shall reach the Nentyarch all the sooner if I use it, even
without his blessing."
"So be it," said the elf.
Gunggari spoke up, "Shall we leave immediately?"
"It will take more than a few minutes to set up our
route. I must make preparations using the Keystone. The
dimensional referents must be navigated then posted."
Marrec lifted an eyebrow and put on exaggerated
expression of confusion. For his trouble, he received
a flicker of amusement from the mage. She realized,
just perhaps, that her language might be perceived as
slightly humorous to those who had not the slightest
idea of what it meant. Progress, Marrec hoped.
Ususi rose and approached the perimeter of the circle.
She moved to stand between the gap in two stones that
faced generally west. She grasped the Keystone, which
90
THE PRIESTS

--- Page 99 ---
then glowed with light as strong as a torch but steadier.
Ususi held it in the palm of her left hand. She closed her
eyes, standing quietly. After a few minutes of studying
the mage's preparations, Marrec realized there probably
wouldn't be any other signs of Ususi's mystical naviga-
tion, or was she 'posting,' whatever that meant?
He pulled himself to his feet and approached Ash.
The girl sat on the grassy floor of the bowl staring at her
hands, as she had been doing for the last several minutes.
Marrec pulled out her bedroll and gently laid the child
down for a nap. Without complaint, the child sighed and
fell into a light sleep. He lightly touched the girl's face
with the back of his hand, considering her plight.
"What's your part in all this?" Another thought struck
him. "Who are your parents, little one? Your real parents,
I mean. I bet they're worried about you. A parent always
worries..."
Ash began to snore, very light, but audibly and endearing.
Young Marrec's mind reeled at Thanial's revelation.
Who... what? Snakes? He scrubbed at his head, feel-
ing again the scars hidden by his hairline. His fingers
shrank from the touch.
A dark bubble rose from the shrouded recesses of his
consciousness, prodded by Thanial's words. The bubble
popped. Images and feelings of a forgotten childhood
flooded the young man.
... He was happy. He scampered down a forest path,
screaming in childish delight, clutching his rattle. He
was playing his favorite game with Aunt Sthenno. Hide
and Seek! He laughed and dived beneath a holly bush.
"Where are you, little one?" called the voice of his
aunt, farther up along the path.
Young Marrec managed to stifle a giggle. He squirmed
back beneath the bush. Aunt Sthenno had been known
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 91
.

--- Page 100 ---
to miss him before. Not so Aunt Euryale. That's why he
didn't play Hide and Seek any more with her. She was
no fun.
Mother never played. She left games for her two
sisters. She was always involved in her work, though
she made time for her boy for an hour every night.
Sometimes she spoke wistfully to Marrec about his
dear departed father, but Marrec was too young to un-
derstand her meaning. His aunts never liked it when
Mother brought up that topic, responding with, "It could
never have worked, sister. He was not of our kind. He was
so vulnerable." That only made Mother sad. For little
Marrec, it was just more talk that he was too young to
comprehend.
"Are you... here?" Sthenno was still a little way down
the path. She was looking under a stone she had pried up
with her foot. With an effort of will more concentrated
than he'd thought possible, young Marrec managed to
keep from laughing at his aunt's antics. She moved a little
farther down the path and peered into the tiny knothole
of a tree. "Here?" The boy clamped his hand over his
mouth to keep from chortling aloud.
Sthenno frowned, then moved quickly back the way
she'd come. He'd fooled her. Usually, Marrec betrayed his
spot with some small noise of childish glee. He grinned,
then settled back to wait more comfortably.
It might have been the extra comb of honey he'd taken
without Mother's knowledge earlier or perhaps the warm,
pleasant day with a cooling breeze that kept him from be-
coming too hot. Whatever the reason, he fell into a doze,
then a true sleep, all cares falling from his child mind.
When Marrec finally startled awake, it was dark.
More than that, it was cold, and a night mist had sprung
up all around, making the path hard to see and effective-
ly blurring all the points of familiarity that the child
had recognized before sleep claimed him.
He didn't like the dark.

Then he couldn't avoid making a small noise, but of
alarm, not amusement. The importance of not wandering
off had been impressed upon him on several occasions.
As far as wandering out in the dark, he'd been explicitly
forbidden it, yet there he was. Mother would be so angry!
He broke from his hiding spot then stopped. It really
was dark, so dark he couldn't really see where the path
lay. He guessed and began walking. When he stumbled
into a tree, he began to cry wholeheartedly, no more half-
measures on that front. He bawled for his mother.
He imagined her coming upon him just then. She'd
tell him it was all right and take him home. She'd reach
down, pick him up, and carry him as she so often did. He
would run his fingers through her soft hair, avoiding the
thicker, coiling lengths with a fierce life all their own.

THE RIESTS
CHAPTER II
Ready?" asked Ususi.
Marrec nodded. He stood just behind Ususi,
leading her horse and his. He also had hold of
Henri's bridle, but Ash was mounted up. Elowen
and Gunggari brought up the rear, each leading
their own mount.
Ususi stood before the gap between two
standing stones where she'd spent the last
hour concentrating on the glowing Keystone.
It continued to glow, even brighter than before,
if possible, clutched in Ususi's left hand. The
leather thong the stone was attached to was
wound tightly around her wrist.
"So," wondered Marrec, as nothing continued
to happen, "we step through and we're there,
right?"
"No," responded Ususi. "We step through, and
... you'll see."

--- Page 103 ---
The mage began to trace a line in the air between
the stones with her left hand as high as she could reach.
Where her hand passed, the glow of the Keystone smeared
the air, as if chalk on a glass wall. When she bridged the
gap, she brought her hand slowly down along the edge of
one of the stones, to the grassy ground, back across to the
first stone, then up to her starting point. She'd traced a
square in the air a little taller than seven feet high and
about the same wide. The very moment she finished the
circuit, the forest Marrec could see through the glowing
square spiraled away like an image sucked down a drain.
Then the square was revealed for what it was: a doorway
to an arcane other-where. A cool wind blew out of the
darkness, brushing Marrec's hair. His horse snorted and
pulled back slightly on the lead.
"Follow me," said Ususi. She walked into the dark-
ness, the Keystone held just higher than shoulder level
like a lamp.
Passing the gap from forest to darkness was not un-
like walking into the face of a chilling waterfall, though
Marrec remained dry on the other side. He stood on what
seemed to be a great stone obelisk, fallen on its side. The
stone seemed similar to the standing stones from which
the Mucklestones were formed but broader. Behind him,
the square-shaped discontinuity he had walked through
hung unsupported. Through it, he could see his compan-
ions waiting their turn to pass into the doorway.
As though bridging a void of cool darkness, the stone
path arrowed forward as far as Ususi's light could reach,
which was not all that far. A precipitous fall threatened
anyone who came too close to either side of the path. Un-
deterred by the threat, Marrec peered over the side and
spied an island of stone far, far below. The island floated
alone in the darkness and was moving farther from view
even as he watched it. The island was strewn with rub-
ble, and the mostly demolished wall of some ruin gaped
up at him. The light seemed to emanate from the walls
.
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 95

themselves, twinkling with witchlight. Gazing around
the vast space, he noted tiny flickers of light in every
direction, all moving slightly relative to each other.
"What is this place?" he asked Ususi.
Ususi motioned him forward. He realized he continued
to hold Henri's reigns, though Ash was still on the other
side of the door. He carefully led his and Ususi's mount,
and Henri, through the discontinuity, moving to stand
near Ususi. Elowen and Gunggari followed.
Finally Ususi said, "This is an ancient space, a half-
space, where forgotten things litter the void. If not for the
Mucklestones, I doubt it could still even be accessed."
From behind, Gunggari said, "It seems unnatural."
"It is," replied Ususi. "It is an artificial space created
many thousands of years ago by a race known as the
Imaskar. They used it to store their secrets, their refuse,
and their... mistakes. The Mucklestones can create paths
through it, shortcutting real world leagues."
"Imaskar?" asked Marrec.
"Mistakes?" said Elowen simultaneously.
Ususi said, "The Imaskar are... were a vanished race
of wizards. They accomplished great things in their time,
but they are gone from the face of Faerûn. Sometimes even
mighty wizards can make dangerous mistakes." Marrec
thought she would say more, but she turned and said,
"We'd best get moving. We'll see enough of the Celestial
Nadir to suit us-we've still got several hours of walking.
I'd suggest riding, but I'm afraid the horses would spook
off the path. I've never risked it."
"Hold on," said Marrec. "I'm not sure I like this talk
of mistakes and danger. We've got Ash with us, after all.
Perhaps we should go the long way around?"
Ususi paused then said with an impatient strain to her
voice, "In fact, I doubt the mistakes of the ancient days
survive today. I spoke of danger, but in the past tense. In
all my studies of the Mucklestones, I've never run across
anything especially threatening. Briartan scarcely used
96 ⚫ THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 105 ---
the stones, 'tis true, but he also never faced a real threat.
I don't think Gameliel had access long enough to further
taint this space."
Elowen noted, "If all things were equal, we would go
by natural paths, but I think the risks are higher were
we to take the 'long' way around. There are more blight-
lords than Gameliel. The Rotting Man is after Ash,
it's clear. He's set up ambushes before. If we can get to
Yeshelmaar through this hidden route, and quickly, we
may be better off."
"I agree with the elf," threw in Gunggari.
Marrec made a dismissive gesture with the hand not
holding the leads, saying, "Fine, fine, I can see when I'm
outnumbered." He grinned. "Really, I'd hate to give up a
chance to walk through an artificial, hidden dimension
created by a vanished race."
Ususi allowed a smile to play on her lips. "You won't
be disappointed. Come. There are also wondrous things
to see here."
They began to walk along the path. Straight as a ruler
the path appeared before them, revealed by the advanc-
ing light of the Keystone held aloft by Ususi. Behind
them, the discontinuity closed like an eyelid closing.
The air was sharp, chill like morning air, but not
damp. A faint odor hung in the air, but Marrec couldn't
place it. It reminded him of the smell in the air after a
thunder storm. Sometimes, a light breeze would blow up
out of the void and play through his hair. Marrec was
worried the breeze's intensity would increase, but Ususi
told him not to worry on that account.
To the left and right, above and below, objects floated
in and out of view. Most of the objects were free-floating
islands of earth, rough and crumbling below, but flat on
top, except for some ruin of disintegrating construction so
far degraded that it was impossible to tell what purpose
they once served. It was as if some great hand had scooped
up these sites from the natural world and set them adrift
BRUCE R. CORDELL 97

--- Page 106 ---
in the void. Marrec mentally labeled the floating islands
'earthbergs.'
He saw a few perfect cubes, each face a mirror, tum-
bling through the darkness. When he saw his third he
asked Ususi about them.
She said, "You really are interested in the Imaskar
mistakes, aren't you? Those are them, safely ensconced
in those time-starved cubes. If you don't bother them,
they won't bother you."
Marrec considered, then said, "You've learned a lot
about the Imaskar people since you began to study the
Mucklestones. They seem an interesting people."
Ususi continued walking ahead of him, so he couldn't
see her face. She didn't say anything for a while then said,
"Perhaps one day I will tell you more about the Imaskari,
but today is not that day."
Marrec glanced back at Gunggari, whom he could
barely pick out in the periphery of the light. They shared
a look; the woman was as stiff as the day they'd met,
stiffer actually.
A little while later Ususi glanced up then raised her
hand. "Stop here a moment."
Marrec followed the mage's gaze upward. A great
globule of liquid hung in the void, the glints of distant
lights reflected in its shimmering, fluctuating surface.
He could actually hear the sounds of waves lapping on
the surface of the globe. It was floating slowly toward
contact with the stone path ahead of them. At first Mar-
rec couldn't gauge the globule's size. As it continued to
move closer and closer without actually touching, its size
became clear. It was a few hundred yards in diameter.
"What's this?" asked Marrec.
Ususi said, "Just more random debris-probably col-
lected humidity, but I don't want to get wet."
Finally the wavering globe of liquid intersected the
disconnected stone path ahead with an audible slap.
Marrec tensed, expecting the sphere to pop like a giant
98
.
THE PRIESTS

--- Page 107 ---
bubble, but nothing of the sort occurred. Instead, the
liquid mass merely continued on its way, barely affected
by the long stone column sweeping through its interior.
Finally, over a minute later, contact fell away, and the
globule continued its lonely journey through the void.
Marrec continued to watch. Behind the meniscus of
water, a humanoid form showed itself to Marrec, its eyes
flaring in the light of the Keystone. "Hey!" he yelled, but
even as he gestured, it was gone.
"What?" sighed Ususi.
"I thought I saw something, a creature, inside that
globule. It had big eyes, like plates."
Ususi shrugged, "Perhaps you did. Another reason to
stay clear of the wandering lakes."
Ahead, the stone path was wet, and residual water
pooled in shallow cavities of the rock. A few tiny forms
flipped up and fell back to the stone with wet smacks.
Fish. A few flipped themselves off the path. Without the
floating water, they fell quickly into the emptiness.
Ususi studied the remaining creatures then said, "We
can proceed. Careful; the stone will be slick until the
water dries."
They moved on. Marrec studied the struggling fish as
they edged across the damp portion of the path. They were
eyeless, like some varieties of cave fish he'd heard about.
They'd obviously been there a long time, through many
generations.
He wanted to catch up to Ususi, but he had three
mounts to see to, including Henri on which Ash rode. If
he couldn't be discreet, he'd have to be crass.
"Come on, Ususi," he finally called ahead. "If we've got
hours on this path, give a little. This place is amazing.
Tell us more about it."
When the mage continued to walk quietly, he pressed,
"At least tell me what I saw in that 'wandering lake.'"
Another sigh came from the wizard. "Very well. Keep
in mind I do not know too terribly much more than you.
BRUKE R. CORDELL

--- Page 108 ---
"The Imaskari, extremely powerful and haughty wiz-
ards who worked great wonders with magic and created
portals to many worlds, established one of the earliest
human empires in Faerûn. They were eventually brought
down by slaves they'd kidnapped from other worlds; those
people are now the folk of Mulhorand and Unther."
"Portals... you mean like the Mucklestones?" won-
dered Marrec.
"Yes. They preferred a buffer between their portal end-
points, just in case. The Celestial Nadir was created to be
that buffer. Originally, it was a small space, but after its
creation, it slowly grew over the centuries, becoming a
demiplane in its own right."
Ususi continued speaking, warming to her topic, "More
and more with the passage of time, the artificial plane
served the Imaskari as a dumping ground for defeated
enemies, objects stolen from other planes too dangerous
to deal with immediately, and as a safehouse for valuables.
However, even after the fall of the Imaskar empire, the
Nadir continued to grow. It is my belief that in the thou-
sands of years since then and now, the space has impinged
upon other dimensions and demiplanes, enveloping them,
and growing all the larger for it. Thus, the Nadir is more
than it originally was intended to be. On the other hand,
of the portals that once extended through its core to ser-
vice the Imaskar empire, only the Mucklestones remain,
at least as far as I have been able to discover."
Marrec gazed out into the void, noting the firefly
points as they drifted into and out of view. He realized
that those points represented only motes of earth or
objects that were somehow illuminated. Perhaps many
others drifted unseen in the dark. He said, "What won-
ders could one find here, if he looked?"
"That is a question to which I have yearned to know,
myself, though exploration of the Nadir could prove dan-
gerous," said Ususi. "The Mucklestones are important to
me. That is another reason I must see this thing through.
100 THE PRIESTS
•

--- Page 109 ---
I have to learn how much the Rotting Man knows of the
Celestial Nadir, and if he intends further incursions.
As I've said, some things that lie here should not be
disturbed. There is a reason the Imaskar empire fell, be-
yond that of simple revolt, I believe. It is my fear that a
remnant of that power might lie herein, unremembered,
but potent should it be disturbed."
Elowen had moved closer, leaving her mount in Gung-
gari's care. She said, "You always said... I mean, what, if
not a slave revolt, brought down the empire?"
"I do not know for sure," murmured Ususi, "but I know
one thing; it does not bear meddling if a taint of that
power lingers here."
After that they continued their march without speak-
ing for some tens of minutes. Marrec was contemplating
empty places of the universe, when Gunggari's low voice
interrupted his leaping thoughts.
The Oslander said, "Something is here with us."
They stopped. Peering back along the stone track into
the deepening gloom, Marrec asked, "What?"
"Something that buzzes. It is not confined to the path.
The buzzing sound puts me in mind of an insect, a large
insect. I've been hearing it since before the water bubble
crossed our path, but it's getting louder now."
Marrec couldn't hear it, but he knew Gunggari's senses
were sharper than his own. He continued to cast his gaze
behind, but Gunggari shook his head.
"It is ahead of us. We're drawing closer to it."
Ususi said, "The only way out is through; we must go
forward."
Marrec nodded, and they continued.
It wasn't long before all could hear the faint buzzing.
It did sound like an insect, sort of like a horsefly, but
deeper.
Ususi volunteered, "I don't know that sound, but look
there." She pointed to the stone path ahead.
Marrec saw that the flat column of stone continued
BRUCE R. CORDELL 101

--- Page 110 ---
on straight ahead without deviation, but there was a
strange sheen to it, unlike the stone over which they'd
already walked. The stone almost appeared to be coated
with crystal, like the interior of a geode but without the
brilliant color.
He asked, "What is it?"
Ususi shrugged, shaking her head. "It is a mystery to
me, but it's interesting to look at."
"Great."
They continued moving but slower. The thin crystal-
line lattice below their feet crunched with each step.
While not slippery, the uneven footing made the broad
path seem a bit narrower and more precarious.
"I spy a mist ahead. It covers the path, but we must
pass through it. Let us slow down a bit," said Ususi.
Marrec realized that she was referring to the pale,
wispy-white mist that was coming into the light shed by
the Keystone lamp. It billowed like a cloud ahead of them,
a vast cloud that had settled upon the path.
Ususi continued, "Let me go ahead and make certain it
is safe to enter. I expect that it is harmless... but I would
rather be sure." She seemed less sure of herself.
They waited as Ususi strode to the periphery of the di-
aphanous cloud. As she approached, the mist churned and
gave way just slightly. The mage raised her other hand
and concentrated. Arcane syllables fell from her lips.
Finally she turned and said, "Ectoplasm. It is ephemer-
al and harmless. I am not sure why it has been drawn into
this space; it is normally a purely astral phenomenon."
Marrec was not familiar with astral phenomena, but
he thought that the milky strands and gossamer draper-
ies lent the path a dreamlike quality. He motioned for the
rest of the group to follow behind. As they moved forward,
the geode-like quality of the path become more apparent.
He decided that the mist and the crystal were associated.
The buzzing grew louder.
"Be alert," called Elowen from behind. "That noise has
102 . THE PRIESTS

--- Page 111 ---
a predatory sound to it-it is something a hunter might
make to flush out prey or freeze it with fear."
Marrec sighed but managed to get Justlance from its
sheath on his back with one hand while maintaining a
grip on the horses, and not a moment too soon.
A white-bodied creature punched through the mist
from above, its buzz becoming a roar of rapid-beating
wings. It was like an albino wasp, though a wasp grown
as large as a man. Its wings, stinger, and even its eyes
were milk white. It almost seemed a sculpture of purest
ivory, though animate and hungry. As it stooped on Ususi,
Marrec cast Justlance.
His spear leapt at the swooping monster; the creature
broke off its dive seconds before striking the mage to
avoid the spear. Justlance continued its trajectory into
the void. Marrec felt a moment of disquiet, watching his
spear drop away; he didn't fully understand the proper-
ties of the artificial space. What if... Justlance slapped
back into his grip, and he stopped worrying.
He could hear Ususi muttering, "...should have discor-
porated long ago-what could allow a construct to persist
so long? Maybe it's newly constructed..."
"Heads up!" shouted Marrec.
The white wasp returned for another pass. He wor-
ried that it didn't have to bring its stinger to bear to
make a lethal attack. It only had to knock one of them
off the path.
Two arrows, one following the other by only a few
hands' breadths, hissed into the beast's abdomen. Elow-
en's work. The creature wavered, but it didn't squeal or
even bleed. He made a new conjecture-the monstrous
white wasp was composed of compacted white mist, the
'ectoplasm,' that surrounded them.
The arrows hurt it. Its buzzing was erratic. Embold-
ened, he threw Justlance straight into the creature. The
shaft of the spear continued through the creature's body,
exiting the other side. Apparently that was too much
BRUCE R. CORDELL 103

--- Page 112 ---
disruption. The buzz of its rapidly beating wings ceased,
and it dropped like a stone in a well, striking the stone
path hard. The slap of impact was loud and ultimately
lethal. The creature misted away, evaporating into so
many disconnected milky strands. Marrec's intuition
had been right.
"Interesting 'astral phenomena' you have here, Ususi,
but let's go," he decided. "There could be more."
They began to move again but were still hindered by
the uneven footing. Not more than twenty paces further
along they discovered the source of the milky haze.
Ususi stood before a sort of outcropping on the path,
or perhaps it was more like a gargantuan sculpture had
fallen upon the path. It was a sculpture of real stone,
too, unlike the wasp formed of clingy mist. The force of
the sculpture's fall had apparently broken it in two, for
only the upper half of the figure, which resembled the
rough form of a muscular man, remained; the midriff
and lower portion must have dropped away in the dark-
ness. The interior of the split sculpture was hollow and
truly resembled a geode with its rough crystal coating.
The hollow was large enough that two people could walk
abreast into it. Purplish light was strong within that
cavity, but it was impossible to see what generated the
light without entering.
Ususi made as if to do just that, an eager expression
animating her normal placid features.
"Ususi!" exclaimed Marrec and Elowen simultaneously.
The mage paused, her gaze sweeping across the group
before finally coming to rest on Ash. She had the grace to
look just the slightest bit guilty.
Marrec said, "That's right. We're not here to explore.
We need to get Ash out of here. We're putting her in
jeopardy by our mere presence. We've already faced more
threat than you indicated was possible here."
Ususi didn't move, torn between her task and her urge
to explore.

Elowen coaxed the mage, "You can explore later, after
we've gotten through to Yeshelmaar. Leave the exit open,
and you can return on this very route."
"Very well," sighed Ususi. "Of course you're right. Even
after the Nentyarch relieves me of the Keystone, if I leave
the exit open, any of us could return along this path."
They marched past the enigmatic half-figure, its in-
terior glowing with mystery.

THE
RIESTS
CHAPTER 12
The Great Dale is a long, fertile vale running
three hundred miles east from the town of Uth-
mere, a port city on the Sea of Fallen Stars. The
Great Dale divides the Forest of Lethyr from the
dark and deadly Rawlinswood, two of the great-
est forests of Faerûn. Governed by a council of
druids, the independent clanholds of the Great
Dale stand amid the ancient ruins of old Narfell,
a demon-haunted realm whose dark legacy still
threatens the surrounding lands even a thou-
sand years after its destruction.
Near the center of the Great Dale, a great
rocky tor rises from Lethyr forest. A pristine
lake of clear, cold water stands at the foot of the
hill. Carved into the tor is an old wood elf strong-
hold known as Yeshelmaar.
A hole opened in empty air near the tor. From
it issued several travelers and their mounts: Two

--- Page 115 ---
women (one an elf), two men (one dressed quite barbari-
cally), and a child on a pony. They travelers walked their
mounts out of the dark into the grass. Horses and people
seemed relieved to have reached the end of their journey.
Marrec studied the great fortress of natural stone and
fitted blocks that crowned the great tor. "Yeshelmaar?"
The elf woman, Elowen, nodded confirmation. "The
Nentyarch's seat-in-exile, if Briartan was right. Look,"
she gestured to the top of the natural fortress, where
great green banners cracked and blew in the wind. "The
banner on the right signifies the Circle of Leth, the one
on the left, the Nentyarch. It is true; he is here."
"This place looks old. What was it before the Ne-
ntyarch took over?" wondered Gunggari.
Elowen responded, "This fortress was built in the days
when the Lethyr elves were faced with destruction at the
hands of the Empire of Narfell, a sinister force to the
north, but such battles are long past. The threat of old
Narfell is long gone, but so are the elven-folk of Lethyr.
Of the wood elves who once lived nearby, only a few small
villages survive. The Circle decided the fortress would
make an ideal base. When pressed, I guess the Nentyarch
did, too."
"Where were the Circle and the Nentyarch before?"
"The Nentyarch and his High Druids formerly dwelled
together at Dun-Tharos in the Rawlinswood," said Elowen
in a low tone.
Before she could say more, several elves issued from
a low gate on the hill and moved forward. They were
dressed in the colors of the Circle and wore leathers, bore
equipment, and were branded with insignia not dissimi-
lar to Elowen's. All had bows in hand but refrained from
nocking arrows.
Elowen moved forward waving, and called, "Hail,
hunters. I've returned with important news for the Circle
and for the Nentyarch himself."
The approaching elves stopped short, grins breaking
BRUCE R. CORDELL 107

--- Page 116 ---
out on many of their faces. One who seemed less pleased
continued forward, a man with darker green leather
armor and a silver leaf-shaped pin clasping a sea-green
cloak on his back. He eyed Elowen and the rest of the
group carefully, paying particular attention to Gung-
gari, before returning his gaze to Elowen.
He said, "So the lone hunter deigns to return to the
fold, after an absence of over two years."
Elowen flushed but said calmly, "You know why, Fal-
lon. I promised the Nentyarch that I would discover the
origin of the blighted volodnis and what they sought to
the south. I have discovered an answer to both of these
questions, though more questions have surfaced. I have
come to speak to Nentyarch."
The other elf frowned, "Reports are customary dur-
ing the interim of so long an absence, I need not remind
you."
Elowen's chin jutted forward, "Let us see what the Cir-
cle has to say about it; such matters are not for a hunter
to determine. As far as I can see, you are still a Nentyar
hunter, Fallon."
Marrec cleared his throat, interrupting what may
have been a heated response on Fallon's part, and said,
"We seek an audience with the Nentyarch. We have infor-
mation that bears directly on his governance of the forest
and the movements of his enemy, the Rotting Man."
The elves all blanched at that name. Fallon said with
ill grace, "The Nentyarch does not turn away those who
seek him. However, his Spring Court has concluded for
the day. He will receive you tomorrow."
"Hold on," began Marrec, but Elowen laid a restrain-
ing hand on his arm.
She looked at Fallon and said, "Tomorrow is fine."
Fallon turned, saying, "Then follow me. We can put all
of you up tonight in guest quarters. You can freshen up,
visit the Yeshelmaar market, small as it is, and restore
yourselves before you see the Nentyarch, tomorrow, but,"
108 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 117 ---
he paused before forging ahead, "Elowen must come with
us. We must take her before the Circle of Leth. It is they
whom a hunter must answer to, and it is from the Circle
any admonishment shall come."
Gunggari had moved up to stand abreast of Marrec
and Elowen as they spoke with Fallon. He said, "We would
not stand here were it not for Elowen. Make sure your
Circle knows that."
"Don't worry, Gunggari, "said Elowen. "I'll be fine.
After the Circle hears my report, I'll come find you all.
We shall meet the Nentyarch tomorrow."
They approached the fortress.
The fortress of Yeshelmar was built originally as a
simple keep on a hilltop. During the course of the wars
with Narfell, it grew, both higher and deeper into the
rock of the tor. Stonework piled on brickwork as roofs be-
came balconies for elevated watch posts, as walls became
foundations for higher walls, and as basements became
the origin for yet deeper halls and armories cut into the
earth.
Each addition added new spires and pinnacles, chim-
neys for fireplaces, and vents for the deepest chambers
where golden lamplight was the only hope of illumina-
tion in otherwise tenebrous halls. The congestion of
construction thrust aloft a mighty work of stone; it
was difficult to pick out where the natural stone of the
hillside let off and the handiwork of elves picked up.
Slender walkways threaded the tallest spires, while
curling stairways provided external access to many of
the towers and lower balconies. In many places, actual
trees rooted in great earth-filled stone planters rose,
providing soothing breaks in the otherwise stern stone-
work. Green ivy grew over the sides of many of the walls.
Despite the clutter and age-worn look, and even despite
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 109

--- Page 118 ---
its military feel, Yeshelmaar yet retained a feeling of
an elven holding.
The travelers were led past the great valves of iron
and stone that served as the main gates of Yeshelmaar
into a wide, square-cut tunnel flagged with granite.
The tunnel sloped steeply upward, but the flagged floor
provided exceptional footing. Many small side tunnels on
either side opened into unguessed chambers, hidden in
darkness, but the main passage was lit with great lamps.
Ahead and above, the light of day also leaked in. After
ascending the slope over the course of a minute, the group
of travelers and their escorts left the tunnel, entering a
wide courtyard open to the sky but enclosed by the tow-
ering walls and spires all around. The travelers' mounts
were stabled at that level, after which they were finally
shown to their quarters.
Marrec's room was high up on the south side of the
fortress, and overlooked the lake and road below. His
chamber opened onto a rooftop garden, which was
filled with greenery and flowers right up to the edge
of a sheer plunge down the stony walls of Yeshelmaar,
all the way down to the pristine surface of the lake and
the hard cobbles of the road. Marrec and his friends had
been warned not to venture too close to the garden's
edge.
His friends, all except for Elowen, were given rooms off
the same hallway where the elves had put him. In fact, his
and Ususi's rooms shared the same garden. She walked
about it, apparently taking a mental inventory of the
types of plants and flowers she was unfamiliar with.
Marrec joined her in the garden. He would try a
friendly gesture and attempt some small talk with the
mage. "What are you looking at?" he asked, coming up
beside Ususi.
"Flowers."
Marrec swallowed. "It is certainly a pleasant evening."
"I suppose."
110 THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 119 ---
Silence interposed between them and grew to a span
Marrec found uncomfortable.
Marrec said, "You seem a bit short in temper this eve-
ning. Perhaps you would prefer that I leave you alone to
your observations?"
Ususi shrugged then surprised Marrec with, "No. Stay.
I have few conversations with people, and even less with
those from so far to the west. Please, tell me of the lands
from which you hail."
"Very well," Marrec said with a smile.
See? He thought. Reach out a little, and you shall be
rewarded.
Marrec continued, "What do you know of the Sea of
Fallen Stars? You've heard of it, then? How about fabled
Waterdeep?"
Later, his conversation with Ususi concluded, he re-
turned to his room. The mage proved to be a good listener,
which was a trait rare in Marrec's experience. Usually,
in purely social situations, it was he who listened and
the other who talked, telling Marrec of himself, his tri-
umphs, his children, or the happenings in his day. When
Marrec did get a word in edgewise about himself, it was
clear that many people used that time to formulate what
they would say when they next had their chance, instead
of listening in return and showing that they had listened
by asking a question related to what had just been said.
Ususi wasn't like that. For that matter, neither was
Gunggari, probably why he and the Oslander had struck
up a friendship and traveling arrangement.
Of course, when it came to listening, none could top the
ever-quiet Ash.
Marrec was Ash's putative guardian, and she shared
his room. She sat on a small bed brought up to the room
by a servant after Marrec inquired if something more
BRUCE R. CORDELL 111
.

--- Page 120 ---
accommodating to her small frame might be had. Marrec
studied the girl, looking for any changes. As always, no
expression crossed her face as she stared without sound
out the open door opening onto the garden.
He sighed and seated himself next to her.
"Well, girl, here we are, and I don't know if we're any
closer to finding out your role in all this."
He held up a small, delicately carved stone vessel for
her to drink from. When she was finished, Marrec con-
tinued, "You and me, we're a lot alike, you know."
He wondered if he had told the same thing to Ash before.
Probably. Undeterred, he continued, "I was a foundling,
same as you, and like you I was not... am not... entirely
human."
He stopped, studying the girl's face for any hint of
surprise. Nothing.
"I'm not a healer like you, though. My ability... is
more destructive. It's a burden. I've done things that I'm
ashamed to admit."
He sighed. Thoughts he had tried to bottle up over the
last few years began to bubble to the surface of his mind,
and his lips.
"I can't help but wonder if my past... crime... is some-
how responsible for Lurue's disfavor with me? Maybe this
is all some sort of test, or quest, for me to finally cleanse
the monster that lives within me, finally repudiate it
once and for all."
Ash began to trace the lines of stone faintly visible be-
hind the wall plaster. Her wide blue eyes reflected a gulf
of emptiness, or Marrec dared hope, acceptance.
"If you are somehow connected with Lurue, then you
know what I've done. You know my vow, too; that never
again shall I call upon the power of my heritage, lest ill
once again befall me or befall those I hold most dear."
Marrec cleared his throat, and went on, "That vow
sustained me in the early years of my service to the god-
dess. All seemed well. I thought it was all behind me, but
112 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 121 ---
with this gradual quieting, and my loss of contact with
her divine spark, I just wonder..."
He whispered, "Is it my crime? What more must I do
to gain forgiveness?"
He reached forward and touched Ash's brow with a
finger. The girl turned, gave him the tiniest of smiles,
then went back to tracing mortar lines.
Marrec spoke no more, but the memory of what he had
done would not be bottled up.
The ranger Thanial's revelation was nothing short of a
life-altering shock. Could young Marrec really be born of
creatures he'd been taught to fear and despise all his life?
How could he deny it? His memories were proof enough,
not to mention the power of his gaze unleashed. The power
to replace flesh with unmoving, unliving stone...
"It is an evil thing you tell me, Thanial."
"Can knowledge by itself be evil? Only the use to
which we put it. Not telling you about your parentage-
that might be considered evil. When you know the truth,
you are free to make the best decisions possible. With the
time we've spent together, I've come to know your charac-
ter, and you are good."
Someone pounded on the exterior of Thanial's cabin
door. The grizzled ranger gave Marrec's shoulder a reas-
suring squeeze then saw to the caller.
It was a boy from the village, babbling of another
attack. The ogre raiders had returned to the village,
vengeful and more cruel in the wake of their ignomini-
ous retreat months earlier. Worse, a truly abominable
ogre, nearly double the size of the others, led the raid.
The boy said the village elders had sent him. He pled for
Thanial's help in driving off the threat, not recogniz-
ing Marrec, who was older and attired similarly to the
ranger.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 113

--- Page 122 ---
Thanial grunted, "I will come." He glanced at Marrec.
"And my apprentice, too."
The ranger shrugged into his leathers; Marrec did the
same. His leather armor was another gift from his bene-
factor. Thanial grabbed his sword, Marree his wooden
spears, and they were off through the forest. Thanial told
the boy from the village to stay in his cabin. The young
villager was too exhausted to protest.
A dark form paced them, partially visible through
the trees. It was Thanial's companion, the great wolf
Shira. Marrec felt better knowing that Shira would be
with them.
Just before they reached the village, Thanial paused.
They could hear screams and the clang of steel through
the trees. They were close.
Thanial said, "Marrec, this is an opportunity for you to
use your abilities for good. Stifling them can't be healthy,
they are part of you. Your actions define your nature, not
your heritage or the sins of your forebears. Defend the
village any way that you can."
Marrec took a deep breath and simply nodded.
Thanial leaped out of the trees and ran for the village
gates, Marrec on his heels. Shira rushed ahead.
The first ogre they saw was dead, surrounded by three
villagers, also slain, just within the gates. Beyond was the
town square. A dozen ogres swarmed the courtyard, each
twice the size of an ordinary villager, but the ogres in
turn were dwarfed by their leader. They swarmed around
the feet of what may have been a giant in truth, their
heads topping that creature's belt.
The overlarge ogre appeared something like a bestial
human grown far too big, but it was larger, stronger, and
armored in the cured skins of its fallen enemies. In its
hand it gripped a wooden club that was twenty feet long
if it was an inch. Rusted nails and the fangs of unknown
animals protruded from its length.
The sight of the leader's armor, with its sewn limbs,
114 ⚫THE PRIESTS

--- Page 123 ---
bodies, and faces, stretched and distorted to make a whole
sheet of leather armor, made the gorge rise in Marrec's
throat. He stumbled, coughing and retching.
Thanial was made of sterner stuff. He charged in,
slaying an ogre outright with his blade, clearing a path
toward the towering ogre leader. Shira followed Thanial,
guarding the ranger's back from the other ogres, a fero-
cious shape larger than a man herself.
Several villagers, those who were not strewn unmoving
around the courtyard, were grouped in a small alley. The
giant leading the raid turned his attention from attempt-
ing to crush them with his tooth-and-nail-studded club
to defend itself against Thanial's advance. It screamed
something unintelligible to Marrec in a foul, phlegmy
tongue and brought up its club. Its silhouette was enough
to completely shadow the ranger's approach.
Thanial ducked under the club and stabbed the
creature. A flattened human face on the creature's ar-
mor clamped its flaccid mouth down on the length of
Thanial's blade, trapping it. The ranger screamed in
frustration as he attempted to pull his sword free. No
good. The giant ogre laughed. The creature relinquished
its grip on its club, and in the same movement snatched
up Thanial.
The ranger struggled in the monster's grip, but the
hold was unwavering. The giant raised the ranger to eye
level and spoke in Common for the benefit of its victim
and anyone else who happened to hear, "I got a few rips in
my armor that your skin can patch, except for your left
arm. I'll bite it off now; saves time later."
For Marrec, time slowed. It seemed that the illumina-
tion in the courtyard dimmed but for a fey light that
picked out his mentor and the giant ogre. The creature
laughingly manipulated Thanial in its grip, trying to get
the man's arm to stick out as he might pose a doll.
"No!" screamed Marrec.
Pain lanced his eyes, as if ice picks had thrust out from

CHAPTER 13
Anammelech rubbed at one of his empty eye sock-
ets, disgorging a gobbet of ooze. He'd thought
he'd felt some sort of vermin wriggling around
in there, but no, it was just an abnormally large
accumulation of slime.
When the blackness birthed itself from the
air, Anammelech stepped back, alarmed. The
void had the shape of a halberd. The blightlord
recognized it. It was Gloomgate. It was the sig-
nature weapon his brother-blightlord, Gameliel.
It's presence could mean only one thing.
"Gloomgate?" inquired the blightlord. Upon
being named, the weapon began to whisper
urgent secrets.
Listening to Gloomgate's tale, Anammelech's
suspicions were confirmed. The weapon's ap-
pearance indicated that Gameliel had fallen.
Gloomgate was his. Anammelech permitted

each orb. He locked eyes on the beast and willed it to stop,
and it did.
A grayness overtook it, and its terrible skin armor
became a gray tide rising on its fleshy beach. Its chest,
head, legs, and arms became as stone.
Something was wrong. The tide of mineral gray did not
stop with the monster but extended to the victim caught
in the giant's cruel grapple. He'd caught Thanial in his
stony gaze.
The entire edifice of stone, man and monster, swayed.
The creature had transitioned from flesh to mineral while
in mid-step. Down it came, tons of weight slamming down
upon the courtyard cobbles. The crash of the shattering,
pulverized stone caught the attention of every creature,
both attacker and defender, that was not already aware
of the dramatic reversal of the ogre's fortune. A rain of
pebbles pelted Marrec, followed by billowing dust. No
piece remained whole. Only rubble remained.
He'd slain his mentor.
The ogres, leaderless and afraid, fled, giving Marrec
a wide berth.
He'd slain the one person who trusted and understood
him.
Shira the great wolf fixed him with an accusatory
stare, then leaped away, howling in sorrow.
He'd proved Thanial wrong. His heritage was suspect,
and his ability evil. With heavy footsteps, Marrec turned
to face the forest. He knew not where he would go, what
he would do, or to whom he would pledge himself, but one
promise he made immediately and aloud.
"While breath remains to me, my heritage will never
again reveal its devilish glare. By this vow, Thanial shall
be remembered."
116 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 126 ---
The Nentyarch sat his throne with calm dignity. He
wore a long linen robe of Lethyr green, his symbol of a
golden leaf shining on his chest. The sleeves and neck of
his robe were trimmed with snow white cotton, which was
also the color of the belt girding his waist. On his head
was the fabled Circle of Life: a living wooden crown bear-
ing green leaves and slender twigs that held jewels. The
jewels glowed with light that waxed and waned over a
period of just a few seconds, like breath. The Nentyarch's
eyes were silver, and his dark hair was likewise touched
by silver at the temples. He was an elf who had tarried
long in the world.
Around the far outskirts of the clear pool was assem-
bled the high druids, the Circle of Leth. Elves, humans,
and a single dwarf made up that group, each seated on
a stone bench, eyes wary and watchful as Marrec, Ash,
Gunggari, and Ususi approached.
Standing out before the pool were several of the elves
who had greeted the travelers when they'd arrived at
Yeshelmaar. Elowen was also there, but so too was sour-
faced Fallon.
It was the Spring Court, too. Marrec had learned that
since the Nentyarch's coming, Yeshelmaar had become
the informal capital of the Great Dale, or at least the
eastern half. The folk of the lonely clanholds of the region
held a deep reverence for the Nentyarch. Many were in at-
tendance today, seeking the Nentyarch's advice. Perhaps
a dozen druids of various ranks and twice that number
of rangers, hunters, and foresters were assembled in the
back of room, along with a handful of Dalesfolk who had
come to seek the Nentyarch's advice or assistance.
Marrec-leading Ash by the hand-Gunggari, and
Ususi were ushered past all those who were there before
them, up into the very presence of the Nentyarch, just
short of the still pool. The hunters at the head of the hall
drew aside to let them pass, and Elowen left their number
to join the travelers.

himself a malicious grin.
Who were these enemies of the Rotting Man Gloomgate
whispered about so fiercely? A cleric-of Lurue? Anam-
melech raised an eyebrow. What a strange coincidence.
What's this? The 'Child of Light', too?
Yes. Gloomgate's silken, silent voice was insistent.
The Child of Light and the Keystone were both heading
toward Yeshelmaar. It was a little too perfect. Fate was
conspiring to hand Anammelech quick advancement in
the Rotting Man's empire. Gameliel was dead, and his only
other real rival, Damanda, was too close to the Talontyr's
heels to effectively advance the Rotting Man's agenda.
Damanda thought boot-licking would get her ahead,
but if Anammelech delivered the Child of Light to the
Talontyr, Damanda's favored position would be his. His
sister blightlord, once out of the direct graces of the Rot-
ting Man, would be subject to Anammelech's long-planned
vengeance for past slights, but first things first.
Time to activate one of his most carefully nurtured
assets in Yeshelmaar. If he planned it right, he could
have the Child of Light delivered to him at the edge of
the Rawlinswood without fuss or muss.
Elves were not as difficult to lure into evil as was com-
monly believed.
The next day, all the visitors to Yeshelmaar were sum-
moned to the Spring Court. The court was held in a wide
sublevel, delved from living rock below the surface of the
tor. Thin shafts tunneled upward to the surface, back
down which beams of morning light fell, illuminating the
chamber with golden light. A pool of crystal water filled
the center of the chamber. In the center of the pool rose a
great throne of pale stone. Subtle designs of leafs, vines,
and other growing things seemed to slowly swirl and
grow throughout the rock, despite being relief carvings.

THE PRIESTS

"Your quest is not unknown to me," said the Nentyarch.
"My hunter, Elowen, whom we missed in her long absence,
has explained your plight and your quest."
Fallon, still standing nearby with the chest holding
the Keystone, shot Elowen a frown. She favored him with
a small shrug in return, the ghost of a smile on her lips.
Marrec responded, "Then can you tell me for what
reason my path has led to this girl, Ash, and now to you?
Do you know what her significance is, and... can you tell
me what ails Lurue?"
"I can try. Let the girl come to me."
Marrec guided Ash a little closer to the pool, then
released her hand.
The Nentyarch studied Ash for a good minute. Quiet
reigned in the hall, save for a few small coughs in the
back. Finally the Nentyarch said, "I can see there is
something more to this girl than meets the eye. If what
I suspect is true, then I don't doubt that all the Rotting
Man's thoughts and many of his agents are bent on find-
ing this girl you name Ash."
Marrec held his breath, waiting for the revelation.
"But I must be sure." So saying the Nentyarch stood
and walked through the crystal pool surrounding his
throne. The pool was only a few inches deep. Marrec no-
ticed that the Nentyarch waded through the pool without
getting the least bit wet. He stepped out of the shallow
pool to stand next to Ash.
"Let us have a better look at you," the Nentyarch
murmured. He placed one hand on the girl's shoulder
and raised the other above his own head. In his raised
hand he held a sprig of greenery. The girl was unfazed
but spoke: "Ash."
The Nentyarch smiled, saying, "I doubt that is your
true name. Let us find out, shall we?"
Then he began to utter a series of sharp, ringing sylla-
bles, one after the other, which continued to ring through
air as if individual voices. As the Nentyarch uttered each
BRUKE R. CORDELL · 121

The Circle member to the right and behind the Ne-
ntyarch rose, saying, "The Nentyarch is occupied with a
fierce contest for the souls of two great forests against
Talona's Rotting Man. We have heard how all of you have
become entangled in the Rotting Man's designs. Please,
tell us more."
The Nentyarch's face remained solemn, kingly even,
as he nodded.
As Marrec prepared to speak, Ususi seized the ini-
tiative, saying "Great druid, I bring you the token of
Briartan. It is the Keystone, long held in safety by the
Mucklestones Druid. We could not prevent his fall, but we
were able to salvage this relic of a bygone race." She held
the Keystone up for all to see.
The Nentyarch spoke, the timbre of his voice a pleas-
ant tenor. "Briartan's fall is known to me. It is with great
sadness that I accept the Keystone back into my keeping.
The Mucklestones Druid will be greatly missed. Few can
hope to tread the path upon which he journeyed, to our
loss."
Fallon approached, holding a very small a gold-lined
chest with an open lid. With poorly concealed regret,
Ususi placed the Keystone into the chest.
The Nentyarch said to the mage, "Your integrity is
beyond recall. You, more than any other, have a claim
to the stone, yet you return it to me despite that. When
we have finished with our business here, I will show my
gratitude."
Ususi's frown hesitated before smoothing away. Mar-
rec wondered what the Nentyarch meant by his comment
about the mage's claim to the Keystone, but then it was
the cleric's turn to speak.
Marrec addressed the Nentyarch, internally remind-
ing himself that the elf was due his respect, "Honored
one, I am the servant of Lurue, the Unicorn Queen. I have
been on a road long not only in length but also in years. I
hope that you may have the answers I seek."

new syllable, the ones before it continued to sound, until
after just a brief time, a mighty melody of rich sound re-
verberated through the hidden hall. Still the Nentyarch
added to the voice, layering on yet more notes. The slow
crescendo slowly built to a sound so intense that many
stopped up their ears.
Finally, the Nentyarch brought down his raised
hand, throwing the plant cutting he held into the pool.
The sound cut off instantly, but light blossomed in the
pool, growing from the point where the plant cutting
had splashed. The light formed the image of a night sky.
The sky seemed idealized, shorn of obscuring clouds, but
sprinkled with thousands of tiny points of starlight.
A ray of light shot up from the pool, becoming a wide
shaft of light. To Marrec's eyes, the shaft seemed to burn
with hope. He reached for it, but just as suddenly, the light
winked out, as if extinguished before its time. Marrec felt
that the light had been stolen away, but as despair threat-
ened to claim him, a tiny of flicker, a spark, rose up from
the pool. It was but a twinkle compared to the beam of
before, yet it was a glimmer of hope.
The spark rose from the pool, moving toward the Ne-
ntyarch. The tiny firefly light came to rest, hanging just
above the brow of the little girl, Ash, like a flashing jewel
bound in a queenly circlet.
As the light blazed stronger on her brow, Ash said,
"Araluen."
The light flickered out and the scene in the pool died
away. Marrec held his breath, looking to the Nentyarch
for explanation.
The Nentyarch laughed. He said in a wondering voice,
"This is the aspect of good long promised. The Child of
Light!"
Wondering whispers broke out in the court.
"I don't understand," said Marrec.
"This is the Child of Light, sent to the world by Lurue.
Lurue long promised a champion of the green, which would
122 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 131 ---
aid us in our long fight against the growing power of the
Rotting Man, who is a servant of the evil goddess, Talona,
the Lady of Poison. The name of this champion, this As-
pect, the true name of the Child of Light, is Araluen. Lurue
sent the Child of Light to contest Talona's champion, the
Rotting Man, but something has gone very wrong."
Marrec gazed at Ash, if he could still call her that, with
open wonder. Was Ash, herself, sent down from Lurue? He
asked the Nentyarch, "What's wrong with her? She is no
champion; she is a frail child. True, she does have some
healing ability, and she defended herself once..."
The Nentyarch said, "This is not the aspect promised,
but only a fragment. She is separated from herself, and
the Rotting Man holds the answer. I perceive it is his foul
necromancy. He has somehow diverted the divine charge
of Araluen. It is possible that Lurue's waning power is
also connected, though I sense there may be other forces
at work, too. Somehow, Lurue is still connected to her lost
aspect. As long as the Rotting Man possesses that stolen
power, the goddess you know as Lurue may continue to
weaken."
"How can that be?"
The Nentyarch thought, then said, "The aspect gains
its power directly from Lurue. The theft of the aspect is
like a slow leak in a basin of clear water. Until the hole
is plugged, the water will diminish. The aspect must be
found, restored to herself, and returned to Lurue."
Marrec pulled his spear from his back, an involuntary
reaction, and said "Then I must defeat the Rotting Man,
to complete my quest, and release Lurue's power back into
the wild."
The Nentyarch considered, then said, "That would be
a mighty act and one we would support, but the Rotting
Man is a great power, possessing the favor of his evil de-
ity, Talona. You see, the Rotting Man, who I also name
the Talontyr, is my enemy, too. He has ousted me from my
years-long seat in Dun-Tharos. I shudder to think what
BRUCE R. CORDELL
•
123

--- Page 132 ---
evil he has stirred up in that ancient grave I sought to
keep under my guard."
Marrec replied, "The Rotting Man must feel vulner-
able, somehow. Otherwise, he wouldn't be pursuing little
Ash so hard and for so long."
"True enough. Perhaps Ash is the seed required to
re-ignite the power of the Child of Light in the world.
Lurue's Aspect would be more than a match for the
Talontyr, I doubt not."
"I will fight him, and I will win," promised Marrec.
The Nentyarch motioned for Fallon to attend him.
He told the elf, "Give Lurue's cleric some history of our
enemy."
Fallon nodded, cleared his throat, and began to speak
as if reciting a passage from a well-rehearsed tome, "Deep
in the heart of the Rawlinswood lies a festering wound,
the wreckage of Dun-Tharos, the ancient Nar capital.
There the malevolent creature we call the Rotting Man
has raised his own dark citadel, marshalling forces of
corruption and evil against the surrounding lands. The
Rotting Man's handpicked lieutenants and emissaries
are the Blightlords. The Blightlords are powerful in
their right, and hold the power to warp the creatures of
the forest to their sick purposes.
"The Nentyarchs of ages past raised a living fortress
of magical trees over the ruins of Dun-Tharos and
chased off explorers for centuries. You see, the treasures
of Narfell's sinister lords lie in buried storehouses and
conjuring chambers beneath the old ruins. Without the
Nentyarchs to watch over the old capitol, the Talontyr
and his blightspawned servants are free to ransack those
treasures for secrets of evil from which the world has
long been spared. The longer the Rotting Man is allowed
to remain in the Rawlinswood's heart, the more certain it
becomes that he'll unleash a fell power worse even than
his own Blightlords." Fallon coughed, his face slightly
red, as if in embarrassment, though Marrec didn't see
124 ⚫THE PRIESTS

--- Page 133 ---
what could be bothering the elf. He had recited the his-
tory clearly and without stumbling.
Quiet followed Fallon's speech. The elf's words moved
Marrec despite his dislike for Fallon. His heart seemed
to be in the right place, despite his sour disposition, but it
seemed more clear than ever what he had to do.
Marrec said, "As many of you know, I've only come this
far through Lurue's guidance and grace. I believe that
Lurue would have me take this girl Ash, this lessened
aspect, and reunite her with her greater self, which the
Rotting Man must have hidden away. I don't doubt this
will be a dangerous journey, outstripping anything I
have previously attempted."
"I and my circle will provide support and aid in this
venture," said the Nentyarch. "With you will go Elowen,
my chief hunter in this matter. Also, Fallon, Anom, and
Cirid, all of whom have accomplished deeds of renown
without peer."
The three so named, Fallon, Anom, and Cirid, stepped
forward. Fallon's habitual frown disappeared in the wake
of the Nentyarch's praise. Anom was an elf man dressed
all in brown cloth, carrying a staff of dark wood. Cirid, a
female human, wore a gown of dark green. Oddly enough,
it seemed to Marrec, a great sword in a white sheath was
girt at her waist.
"I cannot spare more hunters; the Rotting Man's
forces are on the move. Even now, the heart of the Forest
of Lethyr is in peril. The Talontyr's reach has grown long
indeed. I'll not allow two forests fall to his influence. The
Lethyr must not be corrupted."
Marrec nodded.
"But I can spare advice and a route whereby you might
sneak into the center of Dun-Tharos itself unseen. In my
time there, I learned something of the hidden dungeons
beneath the forest. They are dangerous, but better than
going openly abroad through territory completely in the
Talontyr's hands."
BRUCE R. CORDELL 125

--- Page 134 ---
Again the Nentyarch motioned to another of the as-
sembled hunters. That one brought forth a white scroll,
newly scribed, and handed it to Elowen.
The Nentyarch explained, "I've marked an entrance
to the upperdark passages that extend for miles beneath
the Rawlinswood, unknown to most. These forgotten pas-
sageways below the forest eventually connect to buried
Dun-Tharos itself. From there, you can gain entry to the
Rotting Man's center of power by coming up from below.
Follow the path marked on the scroll, and you may have
a chance."
Elowen unrolled the scroll and studied the map inked
upon it. She asked, "Haven't you always warned us away
from these buried Nar ruins? Wouldn't we fare better
taking an overland route?"
The Nentyarch did something Marrec thought was
out of character for such an esteemed and elder elf; he
shrugged, saying, "Better to sneak past the slumbering
evil of toppled empires than attempt to penetrate the
watchful guard of a vigilant malevolence. I call the Rot-
ting Man the Talontyr because his power has waxed with
an influx of divine energy sent by his goddess, Talona.
All who penetrate too deeply into the Rawlinswood are
known to him. The heart of that forest is truly corrupt-
ed, and its trees owe their allegiance to him, and me no
longer. As his power grows, mine wanes."
Without further comment, Elowen stowed the map.
"We appreciate the help you can offer. With the map,
and with the aid of your hunters, we will pierce the Rot-
ting Man's guard and reunite Ash with her greater self."
"I have not finished with my gifts," said the Lord of
Yeshelmaar, who came perilously close to a grin. He
clapped.
A few of those Marrec had taken for simple Dalesfolk
petitioners in the rear of the hall came forward. Each car-
ried a chest, a garment, or some other oddment.
The first walked to stand next to the Nentyarch, who
126 ⚫THE PRIESTS

--- Page 135 ---
said, "Marrec, your coming was not unlooked for; our
dream auguries and moon guides pointed to your arrival,
or at least the arrival of someone like you in service to
Lurue. That you would come with hope for finding and
reviving the Child of Light is more even than we could
perceive or hope for. In any event, we have prepared suit-
able gifts for the one we hoped would come. These gifts
will help you in what lies ahead."
The first of the Dalesfolk produced a pair of matched
gauntlets. The gauntlets were quite thin and sewn of
smooth grain deerskin and lined with white linen. Em-
erald threads picked out the design of an oak leaf in the
palm of each hand.
The Nentyarch said, "Marrec, please accept these
enchanted gloves. While you wear them, a strength like
that of the oak tree will be yours."
Marree accepted the gauntlets and bowed low. Mere
handling of the gloves was enough for him to feel their
vitality. He carefully stowed them at his belt.
Next was produced a leather scabbard on which many
elegant designs were inlaid. A hilt of darkly oiled and
gleaming wood was visible. The Nentyarch grasped the
hilt and pulled forth a long blade. It was a blade unlike
any Marrec had before seen; the hilt, crosspiece, and even
blade itself were carved from one continuous block of
wood. The grain ran with the length of the blade, and like
the hilt, the entire weapon shone as if recently polished
with wood oil. The Nentyarch took a few hearty swings.
The air whistled as it parted before the sharpened edge.
The Nentyarch said, "This is Dymondheart, the blade
I carried when I was much younger. You'll find its edge
sharper than dead steel; it's hard to dull the edge of a
living weapon. I'd like you to carry it for me, Elowen. If
Dymondheart ends its career buried in the flesh of Rot-
ting Man, I will not be disappointed." He sheathed the
wooden blade and presented it to Elowen.
The hunter stammered a thank you, overwhelmed
BRUCE R. CORDELL. 127

--- Page 136 ---
with the magnificence of the gift. She said, "Then . . .
count on me to arrange that ending, Nentyarch."
Other gifts were brought forward-three quivers of
stiff black cloth inlaid with golden thread. Brighter
than the thread were the fletched arrows contained in
each-the feathers were mirror-bright gold, flashing and
twinkling in the torchlight. The Nentyarch drew out one
of the arrows. The shaft was dark, like a line of darkness,
even its tip, which narrowed down to an invisible point.
"These arrows are fletched with feathers collected from
the phoenix's nest on the highest spire of Yeshelmaar, col-
lected only with her permission. The shafts are carved of
lyrwood, harvested in the Shadow Wood of the mystic's
dreams. Nothing can evade their flights. Conserve them.
Once they are gone, no more can easily be made."
The Nentyarch presented a quiver each to Fallon,
Anom, and Cirid. Each was accepted gracefully, though
Marrec was sure he saw Fallon cast a quick, envious
glance at the new sword gracing Elowen's hip.
From his lips, Fallon was all poise and polish, saying,
"We thank you, Nentyarch, for our gifts. They will be a
great help against the Talontyr's forces."
"Now, let me think. I did not have anything prepared
for the southern wayfarer, Gunggari; our presentiments
were not so accurate."
The Oslander shrugged. He said, "I need no gifts."
"Gifts are not for those who need, but those who ap-
preciate," responded the Nentyarch. "Elowen has told me
something of your abilities. I believe I have just the thing,
a gift anyone might find useful."
A Dalesman brought forward an open chest. The
Nentyarch pulled out a plain leather haversack. Open-
ing it, he revealed several small vials, each filled with
an iridescent liquid: purple, sky blue, forest green, and
shimmering yellow. Each vial was held in place with a
cunning leather strap so that all were side by side and
easily accessible when the haversack flap was open.
128 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 137 ---
"Each of these vials is filled with an elixir of potent
magic. When you have need, unstop a vial and drink. The
contents of each vial are displayed by each little figure
stitched into the leather of the haversack. When you have
used up all the vials, return the haversack to me, and I
shall refill them."
Gunggari accepted the haversack of potions. He
scanned the labels, reading aloud, "Heroic Surge, Bead
of Flame, Strength of the Bull... truly you do me a great
honor, Nentyarch. I will use these in thankfulness."
"And last, Ash."
All eyes turned to the girl. Ash stood, unconcerned
and apparently uncaring of the heritage the Nentyarch
claimed for her.
"What gifts will avail you, eh, little one?" asked the
Nentyarch. "What about this, then?"
A final chest was brought forward. The Nentyarch
produced a set of leather straps, chased with green
thread, fitted with a bit and reins. It was a bridle, meant
to be fitted to a horse's head.
"This is not exactly for you, Ash, but for your mount,
Henri. Wearing this, he shall always know his way, and
even should he stray in dark places, he will always be able
to bear you back here to me and to safety."
Ash made no move, nor did anyone expect a reaction.
Marrec accepted the bridle, thanking the Nentyarch for
his thoughtfulness.
"Wait, I'm going, too," yelled Ususi. "If the Rotting
Man threatens Lethyr, then he threatens the Muckle-
stones. I can't have that. I will help you end his threat,
if I can."
"I wondered," smiled the Nentyarch. "I suppose we
can't let you go without a gift of your own to aid you
in this fight. Let me think... ah yes, I have the perfect
thing."
He gestured to the hunter who still held the chest
containing the Keystone. Ususi's eyes widened. The Lord
BRUCE R. CORDELL 129

--- Page 138 ---
of Yeshelmaar opened the chest, retrieved the Keystone
once more and bestowed it on Ususi. The glowing stone lit
up her face like the light of the sun reflected off water.
The Nentyarch said, "The Keystone needs a keeper. I
know of no one more knowledgeable about those mystic
stones. I charge you with the protection of the stones and
with the keeping of the Keystone. Use their power well,
Ususi Keywarden."
Ususi swallowed, then simply nodded her head. Marrec
enjoyed seeing the mage at a loss for words. Ususi solemn-
ly placed the Keystone back into the chest. She finally
said, "I am grateful." A thought struck Marrec then.
"Nentyarch," said Marrec, "with the Keystone, per-
haps we may shortcut the ruined passages below the
Rawlinswood entirely?"
The elder elf looked to the mage. Ususi considered
and said, "That may be. We can perhaps pick up the path
through the Celestial Nadir where we left it yesterday. I
left the exit open. I might be able to forge a detour into the
center of Dun-Tharos instead of back to the Mucklestones
themselves."
The Nentyarch added, "If you choose such a route, be
careful. My dreams hint that the Rotting Man influ-
ences all realms contingent and coexistent with his own.
It could be that you'll find defenses even in your ancient
space."
Ususi looked doubtful and said nothing.
Marrec said, "We will take counsel and decide our
path by this afternoon."
"Then the Court is concluded," intoned the Nentyarch.

THE
RIESTS
CHAPTER 14
The Lord of Yeshelmaar called a feast in honor of
the heroes who were resolved to find and face the
Talontyr. As usual during such affairs, Elowen
ate sparingly.
Afterwards, Elowen, Gunggari, Marrec,
Ususi, and the other three hunters whom the
Nentyarch selected to aid in the endeavor agreed
to meet. Plans had to be laid in such a mighty un-
dertaking. They chose a garden high on the side
of Yeshelmaar, called Skymeadow, which Fallon
suggested for its ideal lighting.
Elowen reached the garden first. Of all the
hanging gardens in Yeshelmaar, Skymeadow
was by far her favorite, so she was surprised
Fallon would suggest it. In her experience, the
hunter always went out of his way to annoy her.
She decided not to waste her early arrival in con-
templation of Fallon's bitter nature.

--- Page 140 ---
She selected a cleared circular space of reddish flag-
stones, surrounded by low benches. A clump of leafy fruit
trees overhung the patio, providing shade from the sun's
direct glare. Papyrus stems and various flowering mints
ran rampant outside the circumference of the patio, save
for the occasional lone fruit tree. Beyond she could see a
landscaped pool, complete with a cool grotto, like a cave,
actually carved into the rock of Yeshelmaar. She could
discern a bronze statue of Corellon Larethian deep in the
shadows of the grotto.
Who was she kidding?
She pulled out the Nentyarch's gift, unstrapping the
scabbard of Dymondheart from her belt and laying the
weapon reverently before her on the stone bench. Though
the scabbard was beautiful, her eyes were drawn to the
grain of the wood hilt. She ran her hands along the hilt,
then grasped it. She expected it to be slippery, but instead
the grip was solid, warm, almost welcoming. She pulled
the length of the blade free of the scabbard.
Shafts of sunlight penetrated the tree cover to strike
and scatter off the length of the blade, almost as if it
were metal in truth. The vitality of the living blade in
her hand was astounding; she could feel the life force
contained within, almost as if she gripped not the hilt of
a sword but a branch of a mighty redwood.
She heard the sound of someone on the stone stair and
quickly sheathed Dymondheart, grinning.
Ususi appeared, followed by Gunggari. Gunggari car-
ried the leather satchel given him by the Nentyarch, but
Ususi did not have the Keystone with her. Still smiling,
Elowen strapped Dymondheart's scabbard to her belt.
"Have you seen Marrec?" asked Gunggari.
She shook her head.
Ususi responded, "When I saw him after the feast, he
was talking to Fallon."
Elowen heard quick steps on the stair. "Speak, and you
are answered," she said, as Marrec popped into view.
132 THE PRIESTS
•

--- Page 141 ---
"Where's Fallon?" he said, quickly scanning the gar-
den. The frown indicated he wasn't happy with what he
found.
"Not here yet," said Elowen. "Why?"
"He said that the Nentyarch wanted some time alone
with Ash. I figured it would be all right... but I've got a
sudden feeling that I shouldn't have left her."
"Marrec, I see him," said Gunggari, "and Ash. Down
there, along the road..."
Gunggari, beyond the shade offered by the flagged
patio, shaded his eyes with one hand while pointing over
the side of the garden.
"Oh no," mouthed Marrec.
Elowen saw Fallon, made tiny by distance, holding
a brilliantly glowing object over his head. Behind him
he led Henri the pony, complete with its new bridle. Ash
calmly rode Henri.
"He's taking Ash," yelled Marrec.
At the same time Ususi screamed, "He's taking my
Keystone, that bastard! "The Nentyarch wishes to gaze
upon its luster one more time... I'll show him luster he
won't soon forget!"
Marrec dashed back down the stairs, Gunggari on his
tail. Elowen knew they were too late. Already Fallon had
used the Keystone to enter the exit that Ususi had left
open. The darkness of the Celestial Nadir spilled out of
the square opening, its strange properties evident even
from the distance.
"Come on!" yelled Ususi.
She charged the side of the garden. Elowen tried get
out of her way but was taken off guard. The mage didn't
change her path; she merely opened her arms wide and
dashed herself against Elowen. The force of the impact
threw both women off the top of high Yeshelmaar.
A scream escaped Elowen as the air roared in her ears.
The sculpted sides of Yeshelmar blurred past, while the
ground below expanded with alarming rapidity. Ususi
BRUCE R. CORDELL 133

--- Page 142 ---
maintained her grip on the hunter, and she uttered an
arcane syllable, which reverberated in Elowen's mind. Be-
fore she quite knew what was happening, she and Ususi
alit on the hard cobblestone road before Yeshelmaar as
easy as birds after a flight.
Ususi released her hold on the elf and began running
with all the speed she could muster toward the portal,
which was already graying out. Fallon and Ash had gone
through. Elowen took a deep breath. No time for hysterics.
She could kill Ususi later.
Elowen sprinted toward the dissipating portal, quick-
ly passing the slower moving mage. As she moved ahead,
Ususi gasped out "Block it. If you stand in the opening, it
can not close."
Elowen willed herself to go faster. Almost...almost... but
the portal was hardly even visible anymore, only a slight
haze in the air. Without stopping, she willed a last desper-
ate burst of speed and threw herself into the haze.
Darkness enveloped her.
He'd reached the last flight of stairs. Marrec screamed
again, "Make way! Fallon has kidnapped Ash. Get out of
my way, damn your eyes."
He was winded, but running full speed down stairs
was far easier than running up. His shoulders were
bruised from a few occasions where he'd miscalculated
the distance to the landing, only to be brought up short
by the wall. He could hear Gunggari still pounding down
behind him.
Finally he reached the main level. Yeshelmaar func-
tionaries tried to get out of his way, and one had the
presence of mind to work the gate mechanism, heeding
his call from higher up, so that it gaped open by the time
he and Gunggari reached it.
He saw the portal, a square of night intruding on the
134 ⚫ THE PRIESTS

--- Page 143 ---
bright day. Only a hundred yards, he could make that
easy.
As he raced closer, he saw that something lay half with-
in the portal. Closer still, and he saw that it was Ususi-the
mage was stretched out across the hard ground, her lower
half lit by the sun, her upper half thrust into the darkness.
She was slowly being dragged forward.
Reaching her side, he saw that she was sprawled
through the portal, lying half across that stone path
he had come to dread on his last trip through the Na-
dir. Elowen dangled in Ususi's grip, her face white with
strain, hanging over the void.
"Help me, you idiot," barked the mage, as Elowen's
weight dragged her forward another inch.
He reached down, grabbed Elowen's free hand and
pulled. The elf was as light as a feather. No, it was the
gloves given him by the Nentyarch-his muscles were
magnified to nearly twice their normal strength. Despite
everything, he smiled as he set Elowen down safely in the
center of the stone path.
Gunggari appeared in the door of the portal, the ex-
pression of concern on his face fading when his eyes found
Elowen. He bent and helped up the mage, who was mutter-
ing and complaining under her breath.
Marrec looked down the path, into darkness. He sought
any tell-tale sign of light. Fallon and Ash couldn't be that
far ahead... but all was dark, without any light to betray
that the path was occupied by his quarry.
"Where are they, Ususi?" he asked.
"They're out there, don't worry," replied Ususi, "but time
may pass differently at the Celestial Nadir's edges than it
does in the Nadir's deep. Though we saw them pass here
but minutes ago, they may already be several hours ahead
of us..."
"Then we must go now."
Gunggari said in a quiet voice, "I'm ready. I have my
gear."
BRUCE R. CORDELL 135

--- Page 144 ---
Still slightly out of breath from her near fall, Elowen
said, "Fallon must be a spy for the Rotting Man or one of
the blightlords. He is probably taking Ash directly to his
paymaster. If we follow this path, we will find him. There
are no side passages on the path, right Ususi?"
"Correct," said wizard, "but I am not ready to go-there
are supplies I must get..."
"Then you can follow later. I must go after Ash," inter-
rupted Marrec.
So saying, Marrec strode down the path. Gunggari
followed.
Elowen gave Ususi a small shrug and said, "The mat-
ter is decided. I'll see you later, when we return."
"Smoke and Fire!" screamed Ususi, frustrated. "That
traitor has the Keystone. I won't let him keep it. I'm
coming."
Still in earshot, Marrec paused until Elowen and Usu-
si joined him. Behind them, the daylight grayed out and
became black. Utter night encompassed them all. Points
of light from distant motes of matter dotting the Celestial
Nadir twinkled into visibility.
Ususi's voice pierced the black, "We forgot to block the
gate open."
Marrec heard her utter a few arcane syllables. A light
dazzled his eyes. Ususi had called magical illumination.
Before Lurue's silence, he had been able to do the same.
"Just like last time we braved the Nadir," said Ususi,
"the only way out is through. Let us hope the exit is not
contested by the Rotting Man."
"If he squats at the end of this path," said Elowen, "our
task will prove all the easier. We won't have to track him
down."
Gunggari chuckled.
"Follow me," urged Marrec, turning to continue down
the path.
They hurried along the stone lane, suspended with-
out strut or structure over the void. On their last trip
136 THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 145 ---
through that path behind the world, Marrec had led
several mounts. That meant moving cautiously down the
stone path. He wasn't so constrained any longer. None of
them had mounts. The weight of his armor kept him from
a run, even with the extra strength he felt trickling into
his blood from the Nentyarch's gloves, but they moved
nearly twice as fast as they had before.
He tried to keep his eyes on the course ahead, scan-
ning for any evidence of Ash's passage and that of her
kidnapper, Fallon. It wasn't too long before such evidence
appeared along the path, illuminated by Ususi's light.
Henri was a horse, after all, and his spoor was enough to
raise Marrec's spirits immediately.
"Watch your step," he called to his friends behind.
After glancing at the droppings, Gunggari stated,
"They are no more than thirty minutes ahead of us, if
that."
Marrec nodded and they were off again. When he got
his hands on Fallon... Well, he hoped that he would have
the luxury of just tossing the elf into the surrounding
void. Of course, running the traitor through with Just-
lance wouldn't be out of the question, just so long as Ash
was safe. Lurue's legacy had been entrusted him, and he'd
squandered that trust. He tried not to think about it. He'd
get her back. Failing was not an option.
"What's that smell?" inquired Elowen from behind.
He paused and sniffed. He caught the barest tang of
salt, like the sea, but the briny smell was not alone. Mixed
with it was a smell of corruption, like spoiled fish.
"More relics come to haunt us?" asked Marrec, looking
back to catch Ususi's eye.
"Perhaps," she answered, uncertain.
The advancing light brought into view a branch in the
path. The main stone lane they had followed for so long
appeared to continue on straight into the darkness, but
a narrower way gave off to the left. Rather than stone, it
appeared to be organic, not unlike a huge exposed root.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 137

--- Page 146 ---
The tips of the root were entangled with the stone lane,
piercing and growing through it, while the thicker por-
tion of the root angled out and slightly up, leading toward
to some unseen larger stem. The stone bridge was stained
a dirty green, as the root itself seemed to ooze flaccid sap.
It was also the source of the smell, which had become
strong enough to wrinkle Marrec's nose.
Gunggari moved to the edge of the root, kneeled, and
ran his fingers lightly over the surface of the stone and
root. Bringing his fingers up, slightly stained with dark
green, he sniffed.
He said, "They took this side way."
"They walked on that thing?" asked Marrec.
"It may have been grown expressly for that purpose,"
said Ususi. "Having held the Keystone, even for short a
time, I have gained a slight sensitivity to the paths that
pierce this place. This 'root' is not part of the system, yet
Fallon, with the help of the Keystone, has allowed an
outside influence into the Nadir, a powerful influence.
This 'root path' may only be temporary. If we want to find
Fallon, we should take it before it disengages."
Marrec steeled himself, then carefully set a foot out on
the root. He expected it to be slippery but was surprised
when the green ooze caught and held his foot in place.
However, when he removed his foot, the ooze gave up its
grasp without complaint.
He said, "The path seems to be ensorcelled to prevent
slipping."
He stepped back out and moved a little way along the
root, avoiding looking down; it really was noticeably nar-
rower than the stone path had been. The root path had a
slight but noticeable slope upward. The others tentatively
moved out onto the root after him. Because the root was
more round than flat, there was only room for them to
travel single file.
Before he commenced walking along the sticky con-
duit, he pulled Justlance out. He felt better immediately.
138 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 147 ---
And so they continued along the strange green path.
The smell worsened.
After less than a minute, the stone lane bridging the
void was no longer visible behind them. Marrec hoped
they weren't making a stupid error. What if the root was
pulled away? He tried to quicken his pace.
"The smell...it's familiar. I just placed it," said Elowen.
"I smelled the same thing when we faced Gameliel in the
glade of the Mucklestones."
Marrec nodded, but he realized Elowen might not be
able to see him. He said, "I thought the same. My hope is
that we are gaining, and that whoever is aiding Fallon's
passage doesn't know we are following behind."
A mumbling voice spoke from ahead of him, "We know
now."
Earthy giggling broke out. A concentration of ooze
at the edge of the light shifted, and Marrec saw that
it was actually a creature; a loathsome, miniature hu-
man composed of muck and filth. The smell worsened, as
slime oozed from the creature's form and it giggled and
chortled.
Marrec hefted his spear into throwing position and
said, “Name yourself, creature."
The giggling eased, and the muck man eyed Marrec
with muddy orbs. He seemed about to speak, but instead
of answer, he spewed a gob of muddy liquid. With un-
canny accuracy, the filth spattered across Marrec's face.
It burned.
He could still see enough to cast his readied weapon.
Justlance buried itself in the creature's stomach. The
creature squealed and burbled, like a man yelling up
from underwater. The spear had pinned it to the root.
But in a feat that must have proved extremely painful, it
pulled itself free, losing a significant portion of its oozing
body. It screamed, and if possible, the stench worsened,
but it wasn't dead.
Translucent wings of ooze unfurled from its back as it
BRUCE R. CORDELL 139

--- Page 148 ---
flowed like bead of water across the top of the root, then
dripped off into the darkness. Gone... but Marrec could
hear heavy wings flapping down in the darkness and a
final giggle.
Justlance slapped back into his hand magically clean
of all defilement. Marrec used his other hand to wipe
away the stinging mud from his eyes.
He said, "Surprise is no longer our ally."
Gunggari, who was bringing up the rear, said, "A
winged foe in this open space is trouble."
"Let's hope my spear in its belly will make it think
twice about returning."
As they hurried up the root, the diameter of the path
gradually widened. The glimmer of a greenish illumi-
nation grew steadily closer as they walked. "Be ready,"
warned Marrec. "Our path is leading us to that light."
The light's intensity grew as they approached. Their
path revealed itself to be the long, slender shoot of an
earthy mass of mud and ooze which hung in the void.
Like a pustule, the mass had forced itself through a self-
made breach in the dark void-brilliant light streamed
through a small gap in space; it was the reflection off the
mass itself that gave the light a greenish cast.
Ususi said, "It's another portal-but it is a breach,
aided by the Keystone's power. I'll see Fallon's head in a
pot for this defilement."
The mass was not static-it slowly heaved and bulged,
as if its surface were boiling in slow motion, and creatures
inhabited the island. The muck man Marrec had earlier
stabbed stood waist deep in a pool of ooze. The portion of
his flesh lost in breaking loose from Marrec's spear was
healed with seepage from the island mass. Two more muck
men slouched near the light-limned portal. The stench had
returned, with a vengeance. Marrec thought they looked
like vicious dwarfs dipped in oil and sewage, with wings.
"What's all the gook those things are standing on?"
wondered Marrec.
140 THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 149 ---
"A manifestation of the Talontyr's power over rot and
decay," said Elowen.
"It doesn't take Talona's Consort for such a trifle," slob-
bered the creature lounging in the slime pool, refuting
Elowen's statement. "It was Anammelech who plucked the
Child of Light from this forgotten demiplane easily enough.
My siblings and I are but extensions of Anammelech's will.
He wants you dead, so our task remains undone."
The three creatures took to the dark air, swooping
toward Marrec.
"That's just great," muttered Marrec. He called behind
him, "Anammelech, I recognize that name for a reason,
right?"
The first creature was upon him before he got an an-
swer. Two claws raked at his stomach, but his armor saved
him. The force of the creature's attack might have pushed
him over the side of the root, but the root's sticky nature
held Marrec fast. He felt a tiny surge of satisfaction in
realizing that "Anammelech" had miscalculated the util-
ity of his root. Despite his excellent footing, he was still
spattered in slime in the wake of the creature's passage,
and the stink assailed his nostrils.
The second creature flew wide past him; he wasn't its
target. The third, the one he had struck before, bore down
on him with vengeance in its muddy heart.
"'Ware my reach, creature of dust, or I'll do more than
stick you this time. Flee or perish," promised Marrec.
"Stick this," said the slime man, as it cocked back its
hand as if holding something.
A green glow emanated from its palm. Its arm came
around and it released. A glowing green viscous glob
sailed at Marrec. The cleric tried to sidestep, but the
throw caught him on the left leg.
He knew pain then. He'd expected the glob to be some-
thing akin to the spittle it'd caught him with earlier, but
the glowing glob was acid. It was eating away at his cloth-
ing and his skin. It was pain.
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 141
.

--- Page 150 ---
But pain was something a warrior expected and could
overcome. He charged his tormenter, running up the slen-
der root and onto the slowly-roiling surface of the island.
The creature could not evade him. With all the power of
his enhanced strength and Justlance's enchanted fervor,
he struck at his tormentor and pierced its head. It tried
to scream around the shaft of his spear, but only for a
moment. A second later it decomposed into slumping ooze,
completely devoid of life.
He whirled, trying to see his friends who were still
strung out along the length of the root. At the same time,
he grabbed up a double handful of the island's muck and
begin to scrub at the burning spot on his leg. He had to
neutralize the acid.
One of the creatures hovered just beyond Elowen, who
had drawn Dymondheart. It threw an acid glob at the elf
similar to the one Marrec was attempting to scrub away,
but in a feat of amazing swiftness, Elowen deflected the
glob away from her and into the void with the flat of her
blade. Dymondheart was a potent weapon indeed. Mar-
rec understood why she hadn't pulled out her longbow to
strike the creature at a distance.
Behind Elowen, Ususi stood incanting, while Gung-
gari beat away the advances of the last ooze creature who
was attempting to dart in and claw Ususi's face. Gunggari
clipped the creature once with his dizheri, sending it into
a shallow spiral, but it recovered.
Ususi finished incanting and commanded, "Slumber
take you."
The command had no effect on either of the remaining
creatures. They didn't even flinch.
"They're not really alive, only animate," yelled the
mage.
The creatures tittered but redoubled their efforts. One
gurgled, "We will have more claim to life than you, when
we've completed the task Anammelech set for us."
Marrec cursed, ceased scrubbing at the acid on his
142 ⚫THE PRIESTS

--- Page 151 ---
leg, and cast Justlance. He winged his target, which
squealed and dropped away. Moments later, the damage
to its wing oozed closed, and it flapped back up, still too
afraid of Dymondheart to close with Elowen. Justlance
fell out of sight.
Gunggari reached into the haversack and pulled out
one of the vials, glinting with red highlights. He hurled
it at the creature bedeviling Ususi. The creature evaded,
but as the vial flew past, it exploded in flame. The wave
front of fire expanded, encompassing the frantically flap-
ping mud creature in an instant, before burning itself
out. All that remained of the flame was smoke, and all
that remained of the animate ooze was a crumbling form
of flash-dried earth, which fell quickly into the unlit
silence of the Nadir.
Gunggari said, "I wondered what the 'Bead of Flame'
might accomplish. Good thing that I did not drink it!"
The Oslander grinned at his witticism.
The remaining visible creature, which continued to
evade Elowen's reach, reconsidered its chances. Breaking
off, it made a beeline for the glowing exit.
"Don't let it get away," yelled Marrec. He wondered
what had become of his spear, it wasn't like the enchanted
shaft to take so long to come back. "Return, Justlance!" he
yelled in frustration.
Elowen drove Dymondheart point first into the root-
path with one hand while her other hand simultaneously
pulled out her longbow. Problem was, she didn't have it
strung, though she made a valiant effort to quickly pull it.
Ususi flipped the latch on the bright yellow wand
pouch she wore on her belt, quick-drawing a slender glass
rod, also yellow, but translucent.
A sizzle of magic leaped from the wand's tip, closing
the gap between Ususi and the creature in an instant, but
the bolt continued past the creature-who had not been its
true target-and impacted the portal. A slab of crystal
force sprang up, completely blocking the doorway. The
BRUCE R. CORDELL - 143

--- Page 152 ---
daylight beyond continued to stream through but filtered
by the translucent wall to a brilliant gold.
The fleeing creature managed to avoid dashing itself
against the newly created wall. It squealed in rage, but
instead of turning to face its foes, it winged off into the
darkness, snarling threats all the while.
Ususi sheathed her wand in satisfaction. She said, "The
Wand of Citrine Force is nearly spent. I like to conserve it
but I did not want that beast warning its master that
we were so close."
Marrec had privately speculated about that wand
pouch. He said, "You may have saved us a nasty greeting
on the other side. Good thinking."
Ususi smiled, and Marrec found himself smiling back.
She had a good smile, when she chose to flash it.
Justlance sparkled out of emptiness, falling into
Marrec's grasp. "Finally," he murmured.
"Everyone ok?" wondered Gunggari.
When no one spoke up immediately, Marrec said,
"Good. Surprise is hopefully our friend still. Ususi, dis-
miss your blockade. Fallon can't be far, and poor Ash
with him."
As Elowen finished stringing her bow, Ususi walked
across the oozing surface to the blocked portal. She
touched the tip of her wand to it and looked at Marrec.
"Ready?" she asked.
Marrec took up a position directly in front of the door.
Gunggari was right behind him, and Elowen was off to
the side, an arrow strung. He nodded.
Ususi pulled the wand away from the crystal surface.
The wall wavered and was gone, as if it had never truly
existed. Beyond, Marrec saw the edges of a great forest.
Behind, Elowen said, "It's the Rawlinswood. Looks
like Fallon couldn't penetrate to its heart in Dun Tharos.
We're lucky."
Marrec studied the scene carefully. Nothing moved, save
branches idly swaying in a breeze. No sound penetrated
144 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 153 ---
the portal's mouth. A great arch of weathered and vine-
encrusted stone was visible at the forest's edge, standing
like a great gate. Further in, he thought he spied another.
Marrec estimated that the mouth of the portal was not
more than twenty feet from the first arch.
"What're those?" he asked Elowen.
"Those' are the reason I know where we are; I rec-
ognize them. They are called the Arches of Xenosi.
Sounds scary, but they're just another ruin claimed by
the Rawlinswood."
"Fallon's gone that way," said Gunggari. "By the look
of it, he's moving quickly."
He pointed to the ground immediately in front of the
portal. The unmistakable prints of small hooves angled
toward the first arch.
"He'll never know what hit him," promised Marrec.
"Let's go."
They stepped through the portal mouth directly into
the mouth of a savage ambush.

THE
RIESTS
CHAPTER 15
Lashing branches behind the portal, poised out
of sight, fell on them as they exited the Nadir.
Marrec was knocked over and rolled through the
dirt. Pain lanced his side. His vision was filled
with violently swaying tree limbs, leafless and
gnarled, like a forest seen too close in a thun-
derstorm. He couldn't see his friends. The cleric
tried to stand, but a large branch smashed him
face down onto the ground.
He heard Elowen calling to her blade Dy-
mondheart and the sound of Ususi chanting,
closer, behind him, maybe. Another effort saw
him to his feet.
Constructions of leafless, interlocking
branches, each forming a sinister humanoid
shape, surrounded them. Faceless, their empty
visages inspired terror all the more. The sound
of their combined movement was horrible to

--- Page 155 ---
hear: a rush of creaks, the dry saw of wood on wood, and
a low roar like wind in the trees. Some were only three
feet high, but others topped ten. One of these large ones
again menaced Marrec, but he dodged the massive arm as
it again tried to smash him flat.
An eruption of flame to his left and behind caused
many of the creatures to flinch. He heard Ususi's voice
"You twigblights don't like that, do you? Just wait, I
have more."
Amidst the rushing, thrashing branches, he saw the
mage.
Ususi stood in a self-created circular clearing lit-
tered with burning twigs and branches. The creatures
outside the periphery seemed more interested in staying
away from Ususi than closing on her. The portal mouth
at Ususi's back, from which he'd exited, was still visible
as a dark void in the air. More of the creatures shuffled
forward from behind the portal, skirting its edge. They
had lain in wait, that was obvious. So much for his theory
about their arrival being unmarked.
A knot of activity to his right and closer to the first
arch drew his eye-he could see the gleam of Dymond-
heart as it rose above the branch tops of their attackers.
Elowen was there, but where was Gunggari?
Deciding his friend could take care of himself, he
rushed toward Ususi. Her magic was impressive, but his
experience taught him that impressive magic often came
at the price of a fragile body. Apparently, one of the large
monsters had the same thought. Just as Marrec was about
to reach Ususi's side, a branch crashed down on the mage's
head. The woman fell like a puppet with severed strings.
"Ususi!" he screamed.
Justlance finally in hand, he drove its spear point
into the dark heartwood of the creature, using all the
strength granted him by his gloves-it felt as if he could
draw more or less strength as he needed. He realized
at the same time that the reservoir of might offered by
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 147
+

--- Page 156 ---
the Nentyarch's gift was not without limit. He used up
a great quantity of that strength with that thrust. The
twigblight, as Ususi had called it, groaned like a live
thing, its branches flailing randomly as it was felled.
When it struck the ground, it shattered into hundreds
of smaller unmoving pieces. Where its heart would have
been were it a living creature, a double-handful of stink-
ing mud burst and oozed. Marrec was reminded of the
ooze creatures they'd faced within the Nadir. He realized
that his strike for the "heart" of the monster had been a
lucky strike indeed. He doubted his spear would have the
same lethal effect on these creatures if he didn't pierce
the 'heartwood.'
The still-burning splinters of the creatures Ususi had
blasted seemed a deterrent to the other, smaller stick
monstrosities. He stood, and Ususi lay, at the center of
that safe zone. The dark portal to the Nadir remained
open, only a step away, held open by the solidified mass of
mud and ooze that made up the island on the opposite side.
He considered pulling Ususi back through to get her out
of harm's way. That would mean leaving Gunggari and
Elowen to their fate, something Marrec could not bring
himself to do.
The creatures were retreating from him and his
fallen comrade. They were concentrating their numbers
where he guessed Elowen, and he hoped Gunggari, were
standing.
The sound of Gunggari's dizheri blared forth. Marrec
grinned. The tattooed warrior was still up and around.
The twigblights surged forward, redoubling their ef-
forts to win into the center of the knot of activity where
Dymondheart flailed and the dizheri played. Without
the press of monsters battering him, Marrec was better
able to see the focus of their attention. Finally, he caught
glimpses of Elowen and Gunggari together, fighting
back-to-back. They were fighting furiously and would
need a respite soon, but he couldn't leave Ususi alone.
148 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 157 ---
When chance gave him another glimpse of Gunggari
through the thrashing limbs, Marrec cupped his hands.
and yelled at the top of his lungs, "Flee into the arches-
you're too vulnerable out here."
Gunggari darted his gaze toward Marrec. He nodded.
Seconds later Marrec's line of sight was again obscured,
but the concentration of creatures surged forward un-
der the first stone arch of Xenosi. The arches were too
narrow for the whole mass of attackers. The twigblights
were unable to maintain the ferocity of their assault,
and those on the sides were forced to peel away. A great
creaking crackled and popped through the air. Marrec
wondered if the creatures were concerned that their
quarry would escape or frustrated that their plan to
ambush and overwhelm had failed.
Not all the creatures followed after Elowen and Gung-
gari. A handful turned back toward him, one almost as
large as the creature he'd earlier vanquished with a
thrust of Justlance.
He'd been saving one last spell of healing, holding onto
it for a desperate situation. The current situation quali-
fied, he decided. Without Ususi's aid, he doubted his spear
alone would see him through the conflict. That's when the
temptation thrust up from his subconscious, like a bubble
of poisonous gas seeping to a swamp surface. He could call
on his heritage; he could use his talent. He could end the
threat then and there.
"No," he uttered out loud.
It was too much. He'd sworn to himself.....
Thrusting the thought from his mind, he bent and
recited the spell of healing on the fallen mage. With
Ususi's magical arsenal at hand, there would be no reason
to bring his talent into it, but the temptation, awake once
more, settled into the back of his mind, waiting.
Ususi groaned, her eyes fluttering, when the bluish
gleam of his healing magic faded from her skin.
"Up and at 'em," Marrec cajoled. "We're about to have
•
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 149

--- Page 158 ---
company. Why don't you show them the hot end of a fire
blast?"
Ususi mumbled something, then took Marrec's prof-
fered hand. He helped her to stand, but her grip was weak
and shaking. His healing spell had brought her to con-
sciousness, but he realized the woman was still hurt.
Her eyes widened, and she pointed behind.
Marrec whirled in time to see the last ooze man fly
from the still-open portal mouth, its flapping wings spat-
tering droplets of muck. When it saw Ususi and Marrec,
it crowed in delight then croaked, "Anammelech is com-
ing! Anammelech is coming!"
The twigblights, their courage restored by Ususi's
weakness, pressed them from the other side. They were
only twenty or thirty feet away and moving closer with a
determined step, if constructs of dead tree branches can
be determined.
"Ususi, take them," Marrec whispered.
He grabbed up his spear once more, and cast it at the
screaming muckman. The shaft flew wide, missing the
darting, yelling creature by inches.
Ususi steadied herself and began speaking. Her low
tones climbed in octave, and with a rush she managed to
force several sounds out of her mouth simultaneously. A
wave of red flame was born from the path of her waving
hand. The semicircle of fire grew in height and width and
rushed away from her toward the returning twighlights.
The fiery front broke over the creatures like a true wave.
Marrec could feel the heat even from where he stood, as
five of the creatures caught fire immediately, sending
streams of oily smoke into the sky. The crackle and snap
of burning twigblight was loud. The remaining three
creatures danced away, apparently in full retreat.
"Way to go, Ususi," he congratulated the mage. She
graced him with another of her rare smiles.
The muckman continued its disturbing chant about
the imminent arrival of Anammelech. It opened the
150 . THE PRIESTS

--- Page 159 ---
distance between itself and Marrec, wary of Justlance's
sudden return to Marrec's grasp.
Without warning, the creature exploded.
Ooze and odiferous mud splattered Marrec and Ususi.
All that remained of the muck creature was a crater-like
circle, its circumference formed by its remains.
"Well... that was convenient," opined Marrec after a
few seconds of examination.
Ususi studied muck crater, concentration wrinkling
her brow. She said, "That was no accident."
"You think it blew itself up on purpose?"
She responded, "The master calling home his familiar,
perhaps."
"Messy way to say, 'here, boy,' don't you think?"
Ususi sighed, "Do you make a joke of everything?"
"Only when I've just escaped death by a nail's breadth,"
confided Marrec, grinning.
"You know, I have noticed you don't always joke.
"Hmm?" Marrec raised an eyebrow.
"Most of the time you speak simply, even like a com-
moner, but every so often your speech lapses into a series
of formal proclamations, like 'Flee or perish!' or 'Now you
shall meet the cruel end of Justlance!' It is... interest-
ing," finished the mage.
Marrec opened his mouth to respond, but Ususi spoke
up again, saying, "It is a habit I've been studying. It is my
theory that you slip into that manner of talking when
you think people around need the encouragement of a
self-assured voice. Or you yourself need it. Anyway, it is
a theory."
Marrec's felt his face warm. Ususi looked at him with
one raised eyebrow, as if she expected him to cork off with
a sample proclamation.
A gurgle and sucking sound drew their gazes back to
the circular crater of ooze. The ooze was drawing back
together.
Marrec said, "He's returning, be ready." He was almost
BRUCE R. CORDELL 151

--- Page 160 ---
grateful the creature was back-it relieved him of having
to comment on Ususi's theory. He readied his spear.
Yet another blanket of stench erupted from the co-
agulating ooze. As it slumped back together, it seemed
to grow in quantity. Soon there was no question that the
ooze was somehow replenishing itself, growing larger and
taller than the muck man had been. A half-formed arm
reached forward, palm out. Marrec's stomach twisted
as he recognized a sort of dark mirror of himself sum-
moning Justlance. In the half-formed creature's hand
a slender, weapon-shaped object blackened the air. Both
he and Ususi recognized the weapon immediately. It was
twin to the halberd wielded by fallen Gameliel.
Ususi whispered, "A blightlord comes. I am too tired
to fight."
"You were right about the ooze creature, almost. It
called its master, not the other way around. It must be
Anammelech." He grabbed Ususi's hand and they dashed
toward the empty mouth of the Arches of Xenosi. "Let's
try to catch up with Gunggari and Elowen."
Marrec glanced back as they passed from the sun into
the tree-lined corridor framed by the arches. The blight-
lord was almost fully formed and already sliding forward
on a layer of slime like an upright, armored slug. Then
they were fully committed to the cool green hall under
the trees, running over light-stippled earth.
He was surprised to discover that he couldn't see very
far at all along the length of the passage. Some sort of
viridian mist greened out vision beyond more than forty
or fifty feet, if that. As it happened, that was about the dis-
tance between each successive stone arch. Though the lane
was strangely clear of growth, the forest pressed in on all
sides, and vines grew thickly on the sides of each arch, and
some few hung down beneath each stone span.
Like light, sound was also muffled in the lane, though
he thought he could hear the sound of conflict far ahead.
If Gunggari's tracking skill could be trusted, Ash and her
⋅
152 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 161 ---
kidnapper were also ahead. He tightened his grip slightly
on Ususi's hand and tried to speed up.
Ususi's injuries came to the fore. A stitch in her breath
soon became a gasp, and she stumbled. She said something
in a language Marrec couldn't understand. He was pretty
sure it was a language he'd never heard before.
"What?" he asked, slowing a trifle.
"I can not keep this pace. My foresight has failed me.
I know just the spell to speed me along, but I do not have
it prepared."
Marrec frowned but decided not to remind Ususi of his
current diminished state of being unable to prepare any
spells at all. It would only come across sounding petty.
Instead he said, "They are just a bit ahead of us. Just a
little bit farther. I'd rather Anammelech catch up with us
only after we've caught up with Gunny and Elowen."
She nodded, conserving her breath.
They penetrated further into the Rawlinswood. The
light dimmed slightly, but otherwise the trees, under-
growth, and other foliage to either side of the corridor
remained fairly uniform. By that time their forward prog-
ress had slowed to a fast walk. The sounds of fighting ahead
died away, perhaps because of intervening distance.
To keep his mind off their slow pace, he asked, "Why'd
you call those creatures twigblights?"
Ususi shrugged. She said, "It seemed appropriate."
The unicorn warrior smiled and gave her hand a
squeeze. "Indeed."
Recognition of the true nature of the 'dead tree'
standing just outside the arch-defined corridor came a
heartbeat too late, as it stumble-rushed forward on its
tree trunk legs, blocking their path.
Ususi cursed, again in a language unknown to Mar-
rec. No, she wasn't cursing; she was uttering syllables of
a spell. Marrec released her hand and reached for his
spear. Just in time; her hands began to spark with the
imminent release of power.
BRUCE R. CORDELL. 153

--- Page 162 ---
The twigblight rushed them. It was so big that it had
to duck to fit beneath the stone arch under which they'd
stopped. He rolled left, Ususi rolled right; the creature
charged past. One of its twig-claw hands scraped along
Marrec's armor but failed to find an opening.
Marrec drove his spear into the creature's back, try-
ing to find the 'sweet spot' he'd discovered on the other
creature outside the forest. It deflected his thrust with a
weighty claw of gnarled wood.
Ususi's spell generated an arc of electric blue light
that crackled along the creature's body, sending it into
flailing convulsions. The smell of burning wood and
ozone mixed, and a trail of smoke rose to mingle with the
greenish mist.
Partially stunned, the twigblight shuddered and
stepped back. Marrec was ready. That time the creature
wasn't able to bring up its wooden limbs quickly enough
to defend its heart. The tip of his spear punched through
the woody shell and found something soft, yielding, and
odiferous. It shuddered again, then ceased all movement.
Robbed of animation, the creature resembled nothing so
much as an old, rotting tree with vividly posed branches.
"Impressive," whispered a voice from behind.
Marrec groaned with sick anticipation as he whirled
to face the speaker. A dark silhouette, hazy and indistinct
in the green distance, gained clarity and sharpness of
outline as it glided smoothly forward along the ground.
Anammelech had caught them.
The blightlord's armor was either covered with or
formed of hardened ooze. The plates were mobile, soften-
ing, shifting, and flowing over and across each other in
a mesmerizing crawl. Anammelech's head was bare, and
the crawling plates of his armor never rose above his
neckline. His face was filthy and his eye sockets twin
voids but for a wet sparkle far back in each empty orbit.
In one hand he gripped a halberd-shaped hole in the air,
just like Gameliel's.
154 THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 163 ---
The blightlord continued to slide forward without
flexing his legs to stride like a mortal. Marrec saw a
glistening slime trail in Anammelech's wake. He was
reminded of a snail's trail.
The blightlord slid to within just a few feet of Marrec
and Ususi. They both stood ready, Marrec with Justlance,
Ususi poised to fling a spell.
"I guess I should thank you," continued Anammelech
in a conversational tone, "You fit the description of those
who slew my compatriot. I've always fancied Gloomgate,
but the weapon was given him by the Talontyr. With
Gameliel's death, Gloomgate passed to me." He gestured
with the halberd-shaped profanity.
Despite the part of his mind warning him against
striking up a conversation with the blightlord, Marrec
blurted, "Our description?"
"When it appeared to me, it told me of Gameliel's slay-
ing, and about his slayers. It told me of all your plans,
so you see, I knew you were going to Yeshelmaar. I even
guessed you might come here, chasing after that poor
little girl."
Marrec glared at the dark weapon. Intelligent weap-
ons were rare, and those aligned with evil even more so.
Truly Gloomgate was an abomination.
"Imagine my surprise when our spy Fallon gifted me
with this..." said the blightlord as he drew forth the
dully glinting Keystone.
Marrec's eyes widened. Ususi gasped.
"Where's Ash?" rasped the unicorn warrior. If Anam-
melech had the Keystone, he must also have the girl.
"I sent 'Ash' along ahead with Fallon. The Talontyr
wants to see her." Anammelech chuckled, though the
sound bubbled up as if from lungs choked with fluid.
Marrec brought his own spear up, tip dancing a few
feet away from unconcerned features of Anammelech.
"We destroyed Gameliel and doubt not that you'll fall just
as easily. So leave us, and retreat whence you've come. If
BRUCE R. CORDELL 155

--- Page 164 ---
we find that you're following us, we'll be forced to destroy
you. You've been warned."
Anammelech's chuckle grew into a full-throated laugh
of incredulity.
"First," added Ususi, "Hand over the Keystone. It is
mine." She held out her left hand palm up.
"You want this?" asked the blightlord, a playful note
in his voice. He dangled the Keystone higher, causing
it to swing back in forth before Ususi. "I'm afraid I've
grown quite fond of it in just the short time it's been
with me. Quite an interesting little area this trinket
unlocks. Once I've dealt with you, I intend to explore it
at my leisure."
Marrec came to the end of his patience. "You've had
your warning."
Anammelech sighed. He said, "Don't you think
Gloomgate has informed me of your abilities? Even
now, it whispers to me of your failing spells, your needy
spear with its inability to be parted from you, and
your sad devotion to a diminished goddess. And you,"
he turned his empty sockets on Ususi, "are completely
reliant upon spells, especially fire. Good thing fire has
no power over me."
Like the head of a striking adder, the axe head of
Gloomgate lashed out, slashing Ususi down the side.
Black mist smoked off the halberd, tracing its deadly
path through the air. The blade left a horribly long, deep
gash. Blood flowed. Ususi screamed as she collapsed back-
ward then fell prone, unmoving.
"Now, you're dead," concluded Anammelech.
Marrec berated himself for speaking to the blightlord.
Anammelech had lulled them with his calm approach
and insipid conversation. Without speaking, he drove
Justiance hard into the blightlord's body, attempting to
thrust through the migrating plate armor, but the en-
chanted armor resisted.
The moving plates caught his thrust and held his
156 . THE PRIESTS

--- Page 165 ---
spear fast between two segments. He grunted, attempt-
ing to push the spear through.
Anammelech was back to chuckling.
Marrec mentally grasped the remaining charge of
strength left in the gauntlets given to him by the Ne-
ntyarch. In one gulp, all the remaining magic stored
in the gloves was drained and instead danced in his
sinews. With a truly superhuman effort granted by
that strength, he broke through the resistance of the
sliding armor as if it were tissue. His spear penetrated
all the way through Anammelech's body. His gaunt-
leted hands still held to the shaft but were pressed up
against Anammelech, so far had the blightlord been
run through.
"I should have told you," confided Anammelech, his
face inches from Marrec, his breath as rotten as spoiled
flesh, "Armor is just a shape I like to take on occasion. Re-
ally, I'm much more amorphous." The blightlord's 'armor'
began to writhe where it touched Marrec's spear. A hor-
ribly sentient surge of liquid ooze ran up the spear shaft,
up Marrec's arms, and across his face.
Marrec convulsed, attempting to throw himself back.
The flowing ooze had too strong a grip on him. The
blightlord's entire body opened up like a wet glove and
attempted to engulf him.
Realization flashed for Marrec. He had seconds to live,
and his mind was giving him the grace of slowed percep-
tion to allow him to come to terms with his fate. Nothing
he did would matter; all his options pointed to his end-
ing. He could accept that, he decided, but not without a
statement.
The flowing grip of Anammelech strengthened as he
was pulled more firmly into an all-encompassing grasp
of living ooze.
Marrec would die, yes, but he would expire while
being true to his long-hidden nature. Maybe he could
do some good and redeem both himself and the sin that
BRUCE R. CORDELL 157

--- Page 166 ---
still stained his heart since he had slain Thanial so long
ago...
The blightlord's voice purred, close and intimate, "I
told you I knew all about you."
The unicorn warrior whispered back, "Did your
damned weapon tell you about my eyes?"
"Why would it?"
Marrec's terrible gaze was drawn out like a sword
from its scabbard.
"What's this? What... That's not..." Anammelech
tried to heave his flowing body away from the searing
gaze of the cleric. Marrec's eyes had become a strobe of
light and dark illumination, blasting into the flesh of the
blightlord with a transformative grasp that Anammelech
was incapable of resisting.
Laughter was gone then. As the stone tide overtook
the soft-bodied blightlord, one last whimper escaped the
Talontyr's servant before his voice, too, was locked in a
tomb of stone.

can handle himself," grunted Gunggari,
not for the first time.
Elowen gritted her teeth as she slashed
the length of Dymondheart through the form
of yet another twigblight that had sidled too
close. The creature explosively shattered with
the contact. The living wood of her intelligent
blade was anathema to the obscene creatures.
Dymondheart's mere touch not only robbed
them of animation but violently dissembled
the creatures into so much kindling. The larg-
er ones were smart enough to stay back, but
every few seconds a smaller twigblight forgot
the fate of all its earlier siblings and rushed
forward. Despite the dozens she had shattered,
a whole herd of the constructions followed be-
hind them down the arch-defined lane, keeping
pace. Maybe that was what they were supposed

--- Page 168 ---
to do, merely keep her and the Oslander busy.
Elowen guarded as Gunggari paused and got down on
his haunches again, studying the dirt, still on the trail
of Fallon, Henri, and Ash. Elowen's training and natural
abilities were sufficient to follow the trail without too
much trouble, but she had to keep Dymondheart ready.
Besides, Gunggari's ability to track verged on the super-
natural. He made observations about their quarry that
even Elowen at her best could not deduce from simply
looking at the disturbed ground.
Gunggari said, "This track is over three hours old." He
rose, continuing his swift pace. Elowen followed after, her
eyes to the rear, guarding their flank.
She asked, "How did Fallon get so far ahead of us?"
The elf saw Gunggari's shrug out of the corner of her
eye. He offered, "Ususi said time was mismatched between
the interior and exterior of her pathway dimension. The
elf must have exited much earlier than we thought."
Elowen checked to make sure the rustling, creaking,
walking grove of dead sticks keeping pace with them
moved no closer. Satisfied, she stole a glance forward
along their route. The green haze was thicker, further
limiting visibility ahead. The stone arches were getting
farther apart, more eroded, and less able to keep out the
undergrowth. Trees and other forest growth crowded
into the lane from either side. Whatever property kept
the lane open at the other end seemed to be failing so far
into the forest. Elowen had never walked so far under the
Arches of Xenosi. She was idly curious about finding the
last arch.
Though the mist was thicker ahead, their passage up
the lane seemed to have dispersed the haze behind, be-
cause she could see at least twice as far along their path
in that direction. Still no sign of Marrec.
Elowen bit her lip. She was torn between continuing
along after Ash, or going back to see what had become of
the other half of their group.
.
160 ⚫ THE PRIESTS

--- Page 169 ---
"Gunggari, tell me what you think about this," be-
gan Elowen. "Fallon and Ash are three hours ahead.
That means that Ash is at least three hours out of our
reach, but Marrec and Ususi are only minutes out of our
reach. I think we can sacrifice a few more minutes out
of three hours just to make sure everything's OK with
our friends."
Gunggari paused again, wrinkling his brow. Finally
he said, "Very well. We can head back, though I have
never known Marrec to fail any challenge."
"Challenges have a way of escalating."
"True," responded Gunggari. He turned a full one
hundred eighty degrees to face the woody façade of their
chaperones. "Perhaps Marrec's spear is not quite so deadly
against these evil wood spirits as your elf blade."
Elowen raised one eyebrow. "Elf blades have their uses,
after all."
She brought the blade in question up, then swung
a wide roundhouse arc, shattering two creatures that
had skittered too near into a spray of twigs. The others
ceased their forward movement, while those immediately
in front of the two travelers tried to backpedal. The mon-
sters further behind failed to stop immediately, pushing
yet another twigblight forward to lose its cohesion on
Dymondheart's length.
As dead twigs rained down around her, Elowen yelled,
"We're going this way." She pointed with the tip of her
sword back along their path. "If you don't want to end
today a pile of splinters, get out of our way."
As she'd hoped, the larger, smarter creatures began
to shuffle back, herding their smaller, more numerous
brethren with them. That's when all the creatures went
insane.
As if in response to a signal neither she nor Gung-
gari could see, the enchanted twig constructs went on
a rampage en masse. Twigblight turned upon brother
twigblight, with the larger ones immediately tossing a
BRUCE R. CORDELL
•
161

--- Page 170 ---
few of the smaller creatures headlong through the air,
but the smaller monsters swarmed the larger ones like
ants on a piece of meat.
For Elowen and Gunggari, that sudden madness in-
cluded a loss of respect for Dymondheart.
Despite destroying three creatures in as many rapid
eye blinks, another was already slashing past her guard,
hacking at her face with its sickle-like fingertips. She
flinched back, only to trip over a tiny twigblight that
had rushed up from the side.
Gunggari steadied her with a lightning-fast hand. He
said, "Back to back. These things have lost their fear of
death."
A flailing branch scratched Elowen's cheek. Her
counterattack exploded that one nicely, but two more
encroached from the left. One failed to penetrate her ar-
mor; the other sliced her along the neck. The pressure of
Gunggari's back flexed and strained; he was fighting off
attacks no less massive than she, though he did not have
Dymondheart to even the odds. The sound of his dizheri
swishing through the air created a strange melody all
its own, almost as if it were being played in truth. She
grunted as she deflected a twiggy body hurling through
the air-one of the big ones had thrown one its small
brothers at her, but apparently by accident. She managed
to clip the tumbling creature with her blade; the twig-
blight came apart before impacting her.
She yelled, "What's happened?"
She could hear Gunggari grunting with exertion as
he fought off the unrelenting wave. Finally he said, "Less
talk. More sword."
"They've gone mad!"
She realized that if the creatures had earlier decided
to rush her and the Oslander without fear of casualties,
they'd have been overwhelmed already, but the branch
golems were attacking each other as much as the intruders
in the lane. Already more than half of the creatures that
162 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 171 ---
had surrounded them lay unmoving and dismembered on
the ground, choking the lane with so much kindling. A
terrible stench also grew. When the monsters perished,
they leaked a foul-smelling ooze.
Gunggari cried out behind her. A second later, the
pressure of his back against hers was snatched away.
Whirling around with her blade extended straight out
from her body, she managed to detonate three more crea-
tures as she sought to locate her friend. His feet dangled
at eye level. Craning her head, she saw that a large twig-
blight had caught up the southlander in a punishing grip
of tightening wood.
Elowen rushed forward. The creature's hands were
busy clutching the struggling Oslander, so the monster
couldn't prevent her from running it through with Dy-
mondheart. It fared no better against her blade's touch
than the others, and Gunggari awkwardly fell away from
the bed of splintered wood that had been his captor. She
kept the remaining creatures at bay. The creatures were
doing a better job of destroying each other than she could
have purposefully managed.
After the tattooed soldier scrambled to his feet, he and
Elowen backed up to a nearby arch. They sought to get out
of the eye of the madness.
The rampage ended when a swarm of smaller twig-
blights, having just overcome a larger sibling, turned on
each other in an impressive spray of splinters. Finally,
only Elowen and Gunggari remained standing in a lane
choked with debris reminiscent of the aftermath of a
storm. Pregnant silence descended.
Gunggari cocked his head, then said, "Somebody's
coming." He turned his gaze back in the direction they
had just tried.
Materializing out of the fast-dispersing greenish haze
was what at first seemed an oddly shaped silhouette. The
strange silhouette quickly resolved into two people, one
carried by the other.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 163

--- Page 172 ---
It was Marrec, running wildly under the arches. He
carried the limp, lolling form of Ususi in his arms. Blood
streamed from Marrec's eyes as if he wept life itself, or
as if he endured a grief so great that only tears of blood
could express his remorse.
Elowen swallowed, knowing that Ususi must be dead.
Hollowness invaded her heart.
Gunggari raised a hand to the quickly approaching
figure and said quietly, yet loudly enough to be heard,
"Pause awhile, warrior. Lay down your burden."
The sound snapped the man from his running trance.
His blood-glazed eyes focused on Gunggari and Elowen.
The elf gasped when the gaze swept across her. Even apart
from the unsettling red film over his orbs and the scarlet
trails leaking from the corner of each eye, Marrec's gaze
seemed to brush her with an almost predatory jolt.
"Oh my..." whispered Elowen. Something had changed,
she could see that. Some part of her companion had come
alive, and for some reason she couldn't identify, that
thought was somehow distressing.
Marrec stopped. He gently laid Ususi to the ground.
Elowen saw that the woman was bandaged, and breath,
however slight, still passed her lips. "Ususi!" yelled
Elowen and bent to tend her friend.
Marrec made as if to say something else, but un-
consciousness claimed him before he could elaborate.
Gunggari caught him before Marrec fell face first into
the branch-scattered lane.

CHAPTER 17
A bone petal fell from the stem of the flower. It fell
only half a foot to the slab of rough cut stone that
supported the flower's vase. In a way completely
unlike a flower, the petal cratered the stone slab
as if shot from a crossbow. The sound of its im-
pact thundered around the petrified walls of the
Close. The new crater overlaid another, slightly
older crater. Only a single petal remained.
One of the two figures standing near the slab
said simply, "Anammelech is dead."
Damanda had spoken. She had entered the
Close to confer with her lord when the petal fell.
She looked at the final remaining petal. The re-
maining petal signified her connection with her
master who stood nearby. In the aftermath of the
other petal's impact, she was the most important
agent to the Talontyr's campaign north of the
Great Dale by dint of survival alone. Her brother

--- Page 174 ---
blightlords were dead. She remained to be tested.
The Rotting Man cursed, using a language once re-
served for raising abominations by a race not native to
Faerûn. No living creature had spoken that language
for eight thousand years, but such was the heat of the
Talontyr's fury that he broke an ancient covenant in
breathing the words aloud. Each syllable crystallized
into a locustlike entity with hatred for blood and a cara-
pace of shimmering purple. With an effort of will, the
Rotting Man switched to a less potent tongue, one with
less likelihood of its merest utterance binding even his
soul to an unmentionable darkness.
The shimmering creatures buzzed about the Rotting
Man's head for a moment, surprised by their release from
whatever nether dimension they had resided. Damanda
stiffened, wondering if she was going to be tested sooner
than she expected. The curse-born insects buzzed away
like misshapen horseflies but quicker, and with malice
aforethought.
"Are those something I'll have to deal with too?" won-
dered Damanda, waving after the flitting creatures. She
figured that with the way things were shaping up, the
Rotting Man couldn't afford to lose another lieutenant
to one of his fits of rage.
The Talontyr, cloaked in his swathe of rot, ceased his
curse rampage. He spoke, his voice initially unsteady
from its unintended foray, "I rather think yes. Later. We
have more pressing tasks to attend."
"The cleric and his small band?" asked Damanda,
though she already knew the answer.
What else had so occupied her lord's mind these last
few tendays? The Rotting Man was quiet with the de-
tails, but whoever the "cleric" was, the Talontyr seemed
consumed with reports of his progress, which he received
from agents unknown to Damanda, or perhaps via simple
spells of divination.
The Talontyr answered, "Gameliel's failure seemed an
166 THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 175 ---
accident, but Anammelech's breakdown indicates a trend,
don't you think, pretty Damanda?" He extended fingers
not quite bereft of flesh, running them through the air
near the blightlord's face, coming close, but not touching,
Damanda's pale features.
Despite her special nature, she was still relieved to
avoid that touch. She said, "The cleric and his group have
had their successes, but their path seems clear. They are
coming here. No matter their power, they can't hope to
stand against you, Talona's favored, and your strongest
servants, not to mention your... project."
The cloaked figure laughed then. Damanda was
inured to unpleasantness, but she still had to resist stop-
ping up her ears to keep that sound out.
Still chuckling, the Rotting Man said, "Your fellows
had but one task-bring the Child of Light to me here in
the Close. In their incompetence, they not only lost their
lives, but they also impeded the cleric, who had already
decided to bring that which I seek directly to me in his
own misjudged initiative."
Damanda said nothing but leaned closer to indicate
her interest.
"You wonder how I know all this? There is a spy in
the Nentyarch's Court. Yes, it's true. He has served our
cause before with bits of information channeled through
Anammelech, but he took an audacious step. He revealed
himself. In a bid to leapfrog his way into Anammelech's
heart and good graces, Fallon has plucked the Child of
Light from the cleric and even now seeks to deliver the
Child directly to me."
"Fallon? Who's he?"
"One of the Nentyarch's hunters. Anammelech turned
him. This Nentyar hunter is in our pocket. Anammelech
has kept me appraised of Fallon's reports and progress."
Damanda frowned, realizing her brother blightlord
had accomplishments in some areas greater than her
own, another reason to be glad that Anammelech was
BRUCE R. CORDELL 167

--- Page 176 ---
not around to receive the Rotting Man's accolades.
"Anammelech had a delightful ambush arranged."
Some of the joviality left the Talontyr's demeanor. "That
ambush seems to have backfired, but I pray that Fallon
is still ahead of the cleric and that the traitor elf has the
Child of Light with him."
"Does he?" wondered Damanda. "We just 'saw' Anam-
melech fall, how can we be sure that Fallon is not also dead,
and the Child of Light back in the hands of the cleric?"
Her voice was tight. She wondered what force had
overtaken her, making her question her master and
thereby precipitate harm to herself. The Rotting Man
was not one to gainsay without consequence. Of course,
most harm could not long impair her, given her super-
natural resilience.
The Rotting Man shook with some unnamed palsy but
did not strike down Damanda. He turned and walked a
few short strides. He stopped before one of the great pet-
rified trees that formed the periphery of the Close.
He said, "Anammelech plans ahead. He equipped his
spy with a means to communicate with his paymaster. I
can also access that communication link."
The Talontyr began to spew syllables toward the tree,
giving voice to a rough and somehow obscenely urgent
chant. He ran his slender digits across the gnarled bark,
caressing it. The dead wood began to shift and mold
itself, soon enough forming the likeness of a face. Da-
manda thought the features seemed elven and possibly
masculine. Sometimes it was hard to be sure with that
androgynous race.
The face spoke, saying in a weak voice, as if relayed
from a great distance, "Who's there? Is that you, Anam-
melech?" Though the face was that of an elf, its texture
was that of petrified wood, briefly animate through the
workings of the Talontyr's sorcery.
"It is to Anammelech's master you speak," intoned the
Talontyr.
168 THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 177 ---
The expression on the woody face grew slack with
amazement then fear. When it could speak, the face sput-
tered, "My Lord, I... Where is Anammelech?"
"Anammelech is dead, Fallon. He fell to those who
pursue you."
"Marrec and Elowen? I didn't think they had the pow-
er to contest a blightlord. Where are they?" squeaked the
voice, its spike in tone betraying sudden apprehension.
"I don't know their precise location, Fallon, but you can
be assured that as we speak they are growing closer to
you. You have only a small chance to escape them, but you
will, if you do as I command," instructed the Rotting Man.
"If you fail, they'll likely kill you. Don't think that I won't
summon your spirit, from whatever afterlife it attempts
to find, so that I can punish you for your failure. I have
devised punishments that even the dead fear to feel."
Damanda knew that last boast to be true.
"Of course, my lord. Instruct me," shuddered the far-
away voice of Fallon.
"They will catch you if you stay above ground. You
must lead them into a trap, below the boggy forest."
"Below?"
"Yes. This forest was a dark place, even before my ar-
rival," chuckled the Rotting Man. "Why do you suppose
the Nentyarch placed his seat of power here in the center
of the Rawlinswood? To seal the unquiet Nar demons
that still walk the blind paths below us. To stopper up
Under-Tharos."
"Nar demons?" quavered Fallon.
"Do not interrupt me, elf. You may not know it, but
Dun Tharos extends its crypt-like tunnels deep under-
ground, though the Rawlinswood has choked shut most
entrances. While my Close sits at the center of Dun
Tharos on the surface, the extent of the city is far vaster
below ground, showing only its tip here in the light. In
truth, the Close is surrounded by a subterranean complex
of great plazas and wrecked temples devoted to demonic
.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 169

--- Page 178 ---
powers. The treasures of Narfell's fallen lords lie in bur-
ied storehouses and underground conjuring chambers. It
was one of the reasons I chose to take this place as my
own. Secrets can be had here that even I, Talona's favored,
could stand to learn."
"I am to venture into this complex?"
"You are. I am sending Damanda to meet you. She can
guide you through some of the most dangerous portions."
The blightlord smiled slightly upon hearing her name
and the purpose the Rotting Man intended for her. She
always enjoyed a chance to walk Under-Tharos. She was
a seeker after lost secrets, too.
The Rotting Man continued, "You must keep press-
ing forward, Fallon. The demons bound by the sorcerers
of fallen Narfell sleep; you can pass by them, but they
are sensitive to the presence of mortal life, and in your
wake they shall open their eyes. The cleric and his band
will find roused demons barring their path. They will be
turned back, or they will be killed. Either way, I succeed."
Fallon had the temerity to stutter, "What if a demon
gets me and this child that you prize?"
"Keep moving. Do not linger in any one area too long.
Do this, and you will live. Stay alive until Damanda
reaches you. That is the only task you have. If by chance
you should fail... well, the child whom you accompany
may survive events that your frail flesh cannot, but I'd
rather not put that surmise to the test."
"How will I find an entrance?" asked Fallon's rigid
image.
In answer, the Talontyr touched the animate wooden
mask on the forehead. The face screamed in sudden pain.
The wood lost its coherence and gradually flattened back
to stiff, petrified uniformity. The scream faded slowly
away.
The Rotting Man turned to Damanda. "I implanted the
location of the entrance directly into his mind. It seemed
easiest." His eyes narrowed "My new pawn will be entering
170 ⚫THE PRIESTS

--- Page 179 ---
through the Barrow of the Queen Abiding. It is the Bar-
row onto which the Arches of Xenosi connect, after all. He's
nearly on top of the entrance already. From there, he has a
fairly straight path to us here at the center."
"What about the Lurker in the Middle?" asked Daman-
da. She remembered the name from another of the Rotting
Man's foray's into the dungeons. That group had found the
main passage contested by a creature, perhaps a demon,
though that was uncertain, of considerable power. "Won't
Fallon and the child have to pass the Lurker to reach here,
not to mention all the rest?"
"That's why I'm sending you. Intercept him before
the reaches the Middle Lurker. Keep the child safe from
the Lurker. I do not much care what happens to Fallon,
of course. He may serve as a useful distraction, should
the Lurker prove too formidable. In fact, when I touched
his mind, I implanted a seedling of control that should
render him incapable of doing anything other than what
I command."
Damanda took a deep breath. "As you will, Lord. Allow
me to take my leave, so that I can make preparations. I
should depart immediately."
The Rotting Man waved her away, saying, "I expect
to see you again soon, Damanda, with the child by your
side."
"You shall."
Fallon's head pounded, as if someone had driven a
spike through his skull. He couldn't quite recall where
he was...
The elf studied his surroundings-broken cobbles,
through which sickly grass protruded, and nearby,
hooves. His gaze climbed higher, and he saw the pony and
the child seated quietly in her saddle. A silent expanse of
gray forest enclosed them to either side, though they were
BRUCE R. CORDELL 171

--- Page 180 ---
within a partially clear lane. He remembered his conver-
sation with the Rotting Man, then, and groaned.
In fact, the pounding in his head was an image of the
lane, brutally imprinted on his consciousness. In his
mind's eye, a spectral map revealed that the lane com-
pletely petered out at the foot of an overgrown mound
not far from where he lay. Knowledge on how to open the
mound, no, the barrow, rose like gorge in his throat. He
groaned again, louder-not good.
The elf was in pain, but he rose to his feet in a fluid
motion, a testament to his race. The square of a cobble had
pressed a red mark into his face.
Fallon considered, rubbing his jaw. Anammelech had
assured him that Fallon's pursuers were as good as dead,
but it was Anammelech who had departed the flesh. The
blightlord's killers were probably right behind him.
While being caught by those who thought him a betrayer
was an unsettling thought, he was more afraid of his ap-
parent new status in Rawlinswood. He answered directly
to the Rotting Man.
As Anammelech's secret ear in the court of the Ne-
ntyarch, he was well rewarded. Other than his last act,
the kidnapping of a child, he'd never taken any outright
action that made him feel as if he was actively betraying
the Nentyarch. With Anammelech's death, his service
had apparently passed directly into the Talontyr's keep-
ing. He wasn't foolish enough to regard that status shift
as a good thing. He didn't know what would be asked of
him next. More worrisome, he was pretty sure the Rotting
Man cared not at all for Fallon's safety.
Looking through the growth of the forest, he knew
that his options were limited. He was in too deep. If he
fled his commitment to the Rotting Man, he did not
doubt that he'd turn up dead quick enough. Even if he
did escape, the Nentyarch and his hunters would dis-
pense their own justice, if they should find him. The only
thing to do was soldier on. The pain in his head seemed
•
172 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 181 ---
to promise worse should he fail in that decision.
Fallon took the pony's reins. The small horse's eyes
rolled in its sockets, but the child on its back had a calm-
ing influence on the beast. The little girl, about five years
old, judged the elf, sat her saddle quietly, oblivious to her
state and surroundings.
Fallon said, "You've brought me a lot of trouble, girl."
No response. He'd expected none. He wondered if he could
get some sort of reaction out of his captive.
"Lucky I don't have your skin for a cloak. That's prob-
ably what the Rotting Man has in store for you."
The calm blink she treated him with belied any dis-
comfiture the child might be feeling. He shrugged. The
girl was damaged, despite everyone's interest in her. He
hoped her state was known to the Talontyr-he didn't
want to be blamed for her shortcomings. Still, he couldn't
help feeling the slightest bit sorry for the little tyke...
He hastily put that thought from his mind. Down that
road lay a quantity of self-recrimination that Fallon was
not prepared to accept. Considering the consequences of
his actions on others was something for which he knew he
didn't have the moral fortitude.
Fallon led the pony and its rider along the evaporating
lane. He hadn't seen a stone arch for the last several hun-
dred feet, and cobblestones were few and far between. He
might as well have been walking through native forest.
The barrow was visible ahead. Brown grass covered it,
though bare patches of earth showed through in many
places. Only his "gift" of knowledge from the Talontyr
alerted him to the mound's significance.
He moved to the edge of the earthen heap, raised one
hand and inscribed a sign on the air, according to his spe-
cial instructions. By the time he finished tracing the sigil,
the lines he'd imagined solidified to visibility in the air.
"Huh," he commented, surprised.
The sign, a complex figure featuring a star inscribed
within the circumference of a circle, pulsed though the
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 173

--- Page 182 ---
color spectrum, beginning then ending in coal black.
Without further fanfare, the floating symbol fell on the
face of the mound, enlarging in size as it fell, so that the
diameter of the figure easily reached ten feet across as it
impacted the earth. The figure melted away, but as it did
so, the earth framed within the circle did likewise.
An earthen staircase descended downward, the steps
small and cramped, the angle steep. A rush of stale, dusty
air plumed from the opening, blowing back Fallon's hair.
He nodded appreciatively at the entrance's appearance
then frowned.
Fallon lifted Ash from her saddle, setting her on her
feet. He said to the small horse, "You've reached the end
of your use, damn the luck."
Fallon pulled his sword free, deciding to tie up a loose
end. The pony continued to stand peacefully without
moving.
At the last moment, he held back with his intended
thrust. Too much thinking about consequences, damn
him. Ash's mount fixed the former Nentyar hunter with
his gaze then dashed away up the lane.
Surprised at his softness, he decided that running
down the horse would only cost time that he probably
couldn't afford. Maybe the discovery of the horse without
its passenger would worry his pursuers, and give him a
little more time. The drumbeat of pain from the image
implanted in his head by the Rotting Man seemed to be
growing, and he didn't want complications.
Fallon sighed as he unstowed the hooded lantern he
had brought with him out of Yeshelmaar. Its fanciful de-
signs of leaf and bough reminded him again of what was
behind him. He carefully filled the reservoir with clear
oil all the same.
Taking the girl's hand, he and the Child of Light de-
scended into the Barrow of the Queen Abiding.

THE
RIESTS
CHAPTER 18
Marree blinked. Surprised, he blinked again. The
pain was gone, the physical pain, anyway. An-
guish lay like a canker on his conscience, ready
to bite with too thorough an exploration.
Someone spoke. He was too numb to un-
derstand what was said, but it sounded like a
woman's voice.
Marrec tried to focus his vision. At his feet
was a banked campfire within a circle of stones.
He recognized the stones as cobbles dug up from
the lane he'd been traversing when Anammelech
had caught them...
He groaned, bringing the heels of his hands
to his eyes. He rubbed, too vigorously, and saw
stars. He didn't care. He'd rub his eyes out of their
sockets if he could.
Hands, small but strong, grasped his wrists.
He let the hands, soft, draw his own hands away

--- Page 184 ---
from his eyes. It was the mage, pale, ragged, but alive.
"Ususi!" Despite his resolve, his spirits rose a fraction.
"I thought the blightlord killed you."
"He nearly did. He would have finished the job, but you
must have stopped him. The others tell me you rescued
me, carrying me like a child."
Marrec shook his head, saying "I don't remember what
happened after I killed Anammelech."
"How did you manage it? He had a power in him un-
like any that I've ever faced. I feared both our tales were
at a close."
Marrec looked grim.
"Why the frown, Marrec?" asked Ususi. "It was him or
me, and I like to think I was the better choice." Ususi bent
forward and delivered a quick kiss to his cheek. "Thank
you."
Though Marrec struggled mightily, the gloom in
which he wrapped himself lightened by a measure. He
muttered, "You're welcome."
Ususi smiled. "Now, get up. Elowen and Gunggari are
anxious to be off after Fallon and Ash. That betrayer
can't be too far ahead." Looking past the mage, he saw the
two Ususi named making preparations to leave. Didn't
they understand that his vow had been broken? Then
again, how could they know?
But Ash's name galvanized him. Maybe he was nothing
but a sham of a person, hiding a monstrous heart and a
terrible ability, but that person could still try to do good.
"Get up," repeated Ususi, impatient then. "You're not
even hurt as badly as me."
That was more like the woman he remembered. Mar-
rec pulled himself to his feet. He said, "I intend to find
Ash, but I want to tell you something first. Back there, I
thought Anammelech had ended you. I thought hope was
lost for me, too. In desperation, I had to break a promise
I'd made long ago... I called up something in myself that
is monstrous."
.
176 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 185 ---
Ususi narrowed her eyes, looking a question at Marrec.
Marree couldn't bring himself to say more.
Ususi said, "I don't know what you're talking about,
and perhaps I do not want to know. We all have secrets,
you know, but listen. You are the man your actions make
you, nothing more, nothing less, and I don't see a monster
standing before me."
When Henri appeared, sans Ash, Marrec feared the
worst, but Elowen noted that there were still supplies in
Henri's saddlebags. The horse yet wore the bridle given it
by the Nentyarch. The elf hunter figured the horse had
escaped, nothing more.
Gunggari soon confirmed her hypothesis when he
backtracked the horse to the lane's end. A hole gaped in
the base of a weed-infested mound. The Oslander indi-
cated clear signs that two people, one a child, had entered
the mound, taking steep stairs downward.
"How much time?" asked Marrec.
"Not more than an hour. We have a real chance to
catch them."
Ususi said, "It appears we have reached the dark ways
the Nentyarch described."
Marrec asked, "Where is the map the Nentyarch gave
us? Does it show this entrance?"
Elowen retrieved the map scroll from her pack and
unrolled it across the face of a large boulder. The group
gathered round.
"Unfortunately, no," said Elowen after a few seconds
of study.
Marrec identified the Rawlinswood and the Arches
of Xenosi. The map recorded where the Arches petered
out, apparently where they stood. According to the
map, the entrance identified by the Nentyarch was fur-
ther back, located midway along the lane made by the
BRUCE R. CORDELL .177

--- Page 186 ---
Arches and about half a mile to the east of the lane.
Ususi said, "This mound isn't even noted on the map.
It's a waste."
Elowen replied, the slightest flush tinting her face,
"Don't be rash. If Fallon is heading for the center, no
doubt he shall wander onto or across the route marked
by the Nentyarch."
Marrec pointed to a tag on the map, asking, "What's the
Lurker in the Middle' and why should we 'beware' it?"
Elowen said, "Some Nar demon bound below the earth,
probably, but maybe not completely bound."
Gunggari asked, "I would like to know more about
these Nar. Such knowledge may aid us if we venture into
their realm of old."
Elowen nodded, rolling up the map. She said, "I can tell
you something of ancient Narfell. This is what my mentor
taught me when I was a child.
"More than a thousand years ago the sorcerous land
of Narfell grew mighty on the strength of its unholy
mages and cruel priest-lords. It was Narfell's trafficking
with demons that contributed to its eventual downfall,
though I do not know specifically the event that brought
them down. Secrets of the old Nar lore draw unscrupu-
lous spellcasters who attempt to plunder buried vaults
in search of knowledge and power. Rawlinswood is thick
with these vaults. It's sort of like one extended vault, I
suppose."
Ususi commented, "One can't be a practicing mage in
these parts without hearing about Nar rituals, Nar ob-
scenities, and trinkets of supposed Narfell vintage. I've
found that most are fakes, sold by fakir wizards to the
credulous."
Marrec realized that Ususi was admitting to being
fooled herself on at least one occasion.
"Demons and foul magic, then," said Gunggari. "Can
demons be any worse than the blightlords and their pets
we've already faced?"
178
.
THE PRIESTS

--- Page 187 ---
Ususi said, "They could. Demons are not from the
world. They have an infernal power, and some even have
abilities that could imperil your immortal spirit."
"Hmm," was Gunggari's only response.
Marrec walked to the edge of the mound entrance.
"Let's go."
Gunggari and Ususi stepped forward, but Elowen said,
"Hold on, what about Henri? We can't just leave him."
Ususi said, "This isn't the first time I've heard of such
things-mounts being left at the mouths of subterranean
passages too narrow for hooves. He should be safe enough
until we return. If we return."
"He won't be safe in the Rawlinswood." The elf stroked
the pony's mane.
Marrec paused. He had much on his mind, but he knew
he couldn't forsake the creature. He said, "Henri is too
large to negotiate the stairs."
"Too bad. We could have used a packhorse," said Gung-
gari. The Oslander was nothing if not practical.
"Remember, Elowen, he yet wears the gift of the Ne-
ntyarch. It was that magic that probably allowed Henri
to find us just now. I don't doubt that it will see him safe
all the way back to Yeshelmaar."
Elowen subsided. "I suppose you're right. He's probably
safer than we are, come to think of it. We've just cleared
the path back out of the forest."
They sent Henri on his way. The pony didn't seem
dispirited to put his back to the dark, ill-smelling
stairs.
They descended. The stairs were steep. Worse, the
breadth of each step was shallow. Hard packed earth,
then smooth stone, rose up on either side as they descend-
ed ever deeper below the surface.
Ususi conjured a light, one on the tip of Marrec's
spear, and one for herself. The radiance was strong and
unwavering, exactly unlike the light of a torch or even
magical lights that emulated candle or torch flame to
BRUCE R. CORDELL 179

--- Page 188 ---
which Marrec was most accustomed. The woman pos-
sessed exotic spells, that was certain.
"It's getting colder," said Marrec.
Ususi responded, "That's normal underground."
"No. I mean, I've experienced the subterranean chill
before-this is unnaturally cold."
The stairs ended on a landing below. The light on
Marrec's spear revealed the truth of his words. Ice slicked
the walls, glinting like crystal. An icy arch opened into
a dark space beyond.
Marrec stepped off the stairs and up to the arch. He
thrust his light through to reveal a wide, flat tunnel, ob-
viously worked. The passage was completely sheathed in
ice to the limit of Marrec's light source. Ice sickles hung
like stalactites from the ceiling. His breath steamed out
before him.
Marree turned to Gunggari, "I don't suppose you
brought your furs, eh?"
Gunggari shook his head, "They're back in Ye-
shelmaar. We departed too quickly for me to gather all
my effects."
"Yeah, I remember," responded the cleric.
Gunggari bent, touching the floor. He said, "They went
this way. Come."
A voice, stark and devoid of warmth, spoke from the
darkness ahead. It said something in a language incom-
prehensible to Marrec.
Ususi said in a quiet voice, "That is the language of
the Abyss. Looks like you get to meet your first demon,
Gunggari."
A creature of black ice slid into the light. It eased to
a stop not more than ten feet from Marrec, without any
outward sign of effort or limb movement. The creature
was something like a wolf, though its icy composition and
size belied any thought of a natural origin. Points of red
hellfire burned in its eye sockets. The shards and chunks
of ice that made up the creature flexed and pulsed in sick
180 ⚫ THE PRIESTS

--- Page 189 ---
mockery of life, or with a life usually unknown except in
the cold nether regions of Abyssal provenance. The mon-
strosity was wrapped in stink, reminiscent of a corpse
buried in winter snow disturbed by scavengers.
The cleric made to cast his spear.
The demon spoke again, but that time in a language
Marrec could understand. It said, "Parley." It rose to its
rear legs, standing with an obscene approximation of a
biped.
"Parley," it said again. "Speak with the Queen Abiding.
Make agreement good for you, good for she that Abides."
When it talked, its breath chilled Marrec even where
he stood.
"How can we trust you, demon?" called Ususi, cough-
ing slightly, holding a hand over her mouth and nose.
The creature raised one hand palm forward and said
simply, "Come."
Marrec refrained from casting Justlance. He asked,
"Can you tell us about the male elf and child who passed
this way a little while ago?"
"Ask the queen."
Without looking away from the icy envoy, Marrec said,
"What do you think, Gunny?"
"I have no experience with demons, Marrec, but some-
one told me once that demons are infernal." The tattooed
soldier shot a glance at the mage.
Ususi chimed in, "Bargains with demons rarely work in
the favor of any other than the demon in the long run.'
The creature giggled then said, "Talk with queen.
Good for you, good for us."
Elowen said, "Every fight we can avoid will leave us
stronger later when we may need it the most."
"All right, lead us to your queen," Marrec finally said.
"We can decide if we want to deal after we hear your
pitch."
Daintily, despite its ungainly bulk, the creature pir-
ouetted and slid swiftly back the way it had come. Its
BRUCE R. CORDELL 181
•

--- Page 190 ---
voice echoed out of the darkness, "Come!"
Gunggari shrugged. "This is also the way Fallon's
tracks lead."
Marrec said, "Right. If we're lucky, they'll have his
head wrapped in holiday paper for us, a present from the
demon queen of Under-Tharos."
The group moved forward, their light by turns glint-
ing off the ice that sheathed the corridor, other times
completely absorbed. The tunnel emptied into a much
wider space. Circular, the floor was ice but rough enough
to offer some purchase. The walls and ceiling were fili-
greed with traceries of brittle black ice. Tiny bits visibly
crumbled in places, tinkling. In other places, the filigree
grew quickly enough for Marrec to notice it. Sinister sta-
lactite chandeliers hung like icy infestations above. Up
until then, he'd always found the natural patterns formed
by ice and snowflakes to be enchanting. That was the
problem; nothing was natural. All was warped under the
influence of evil born of dimensions far from Faerûn.
Marrec hoped to see Ash and Fallon in the chamber,
but his hope was unfounded. Instead, the chamber held
only the demon who'd met them and a massive, cylindri-
cal block of ice. Rivulets of water so black it looked like
oil ran in tiny streams from the block, but through some
process beyond Marrec's ken, the block grew no smaller.
As they walked carefully into the chamber, their light
picked out forms in the ice below: humans, elves, a few
dwarves, halflings, and other humanoids equipped in
armor, wearing packs, expedition style. Marrec mentally
theorized that the bodies represented a grisly collection
of failed Dun Tharos explorers unlucky enough to find
the Queen Abiding before them. Fallon and Ash were not
among those frozen there.
"Where is your queen then?" asked Marrec.
Several of the stalactites shifted, dropping from
the ceiling onto four shard-studded legs. They looked
somewhat similar to demon who'd ushered them into the
182 THE PRIESTS
•

--- Page 191 ---
chamber. The newly revealed brumal demons began to
rub their forearms together, creating a keening noise
that drove cold spikes through Marrec's composure. They
were outnumbered.
Marrec cleared his throat and said, "Queen Abiding,
we come to parley, as we were bid."
One of the demons, the one closest to the central ice
mass, slowly rose a limb, pointing an icy digit into the
heart of the ice.
Marrec moved closer to the central ice, bringing the
brilliant light glowing on his spear tip to bear, directly
touching the crystalline surface.
The light leached into the ice, mixing like milk poured
into oily tea. The keening of the demons grew louder. The
suffusing light reached the center of the mass but refused
to illuminate it. Something was held there, a blot of noth-
ing, a dark beetle in amber, something the light refused
to touch.
Their host croaked, "The Queen Abiding."
Improbably, the blot of darkness trapped in the cen-
ter moved. It surged forward, unrestrained by the feet
of ice which surrounded it, as if the frozen water were
but liquid. With a cry Marrec fell back, but the darkness
stopped short of crashing out of the ice. It hovered just
at the boundary, creating the illusion of a wall of dark-
ness where it pressed up against the periphery of the icy
mass.
A new voice spoke then, with a pleasant, even seduc-
tive female timbre. The voice said, "Are these the ones
who disturbed our sleep?"
"No," spoke the original brumal demon. "Gone. Toward
the center. Tramping and knocking, waking the sleepers.
One elf, one child hiding power."
The woman's voice spoke again. Marrec knew it was
coming from the dreadful blot caught in the ice. The
voice had a cloying, thick quality beneath its velvet sur-
face that made him shiver. "These follow after, eh? Well,
BRUCE R. CORDELL 183

--- Page 192 ---
speak up, followers. If my offspring were intent on freez-
ing you into our collection, they'd have done so already,
don't you think?"
Marrec inadvertently glanced down and saw a human
woman's face and hand clutching a bow. He shook his head
and said, "We do follow after. We seek a betrayer and have
no interest in conflict with you, your kind majesty."
The woman's voice laughed. "Majesty, is it? I was old
before your civilization was born. I am she whose name
is unremembered. I served those of such power that they
thought they could challenge the power of gods, but they
are crumbled away now, while I remain, trapped. I must
abide here until I can find the token of my freedom, but,"
she paused, "you may continue to address me as majesty.
It pleases me."
The darkness roiled, as if beginning a slow boil. Its
movements sometimes synched up with the speech, other
times not. Marrec backed off from the ice wall a pace, but
he was blocked from moving too far by the dark icy cara-
paces of the crowding demons. He noticed that his friends
seemed equally crowded. The smell of decay was quickly
growing intolerable.
"Then, your majesty, please allows us to continue,"
requested Marrec, his breath steaming out before him.
"Though you may be surprised to learn it, I will in-
deed allow you to leave this chamber," purred the voice.
One of the gathered demons tittered as if at a joke only
it had heard.
"But?" guessed Marrec, sensing something still un-
spoken.
"But," continued the voice, "I'm afraid I can't let you go
free, can I? There is a condition that I must impose. You'll
accept that condition, won't you, my fierce pet?"
Marrec locked eyes with Gunggari. Marrec raised
one eyebrow; Gunggari shrugged, shaking his head.
These motions required only a second, but a question was
asked and answered: Marrec asked the Oslander what
.
184 ⚫ THE PRIESTS

--- Page 193 ---
he thought their chances were in a fight against the
creatures. Gunggari responded that he couldn't gauge
the outcome.
The cleric had some experience in gauging the power
and threat of supernatural entities. His sense of the
queen's power and level of abilities warned him that to
fight the demon there, in the area that she infested and
controlled so thoroughly, would prove a suicidal task.
Marree spoke aloud, "Tell us your condition. We won't
agree to it before you specify what you expect from us.
If you're willing to negotiate in the first place, we must
have something you need."
The voice was silent for a few moments. The icy crea-
tures crowding Marrec and the others shifted their
weight ominously.
The Queen Abiding finally intoned, "This is the condi-
tion on which I'll allow you to depart alive and without
harm: find for me the token of my freedom and pledge to
return it to me here."
"What's that?"
"It is the only remaining wall, spiritually speaking,
that keeps me bound herein."
Marrec stalled, "We wouldn't know where to begin to
search."
"I'll tell you exactly where it is. It lies here, in the
ruins of Under-Tharos. Those frail-brained Nentyarchs
squatted on it along with all the other leashes and tokens
that bind us who remain locked in darkness. My children
tell me that the last Nentyarch has fled, and another has
assumed control at the center."
"The Rotting Man," supplied Elowen.
"That's right, that's what you call him, don't you? Talo-
na's lap dog. He visited much pain on me, all unknowing,
when he found my token of control when he first arrived.
I owe him much for that. Then, like a dupe, he allowed my
token to be stolen, ignorant of its true purpose. He's since
learned of his foolishness." The voice chuckled.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 185

--- Page 194 ---
"I bet you know where your token now lies."
"Of course."
Marree sighed, then said, "You can't send one of your
servants to run off and collect it?"
"Think a little before you speak. If it were that simple,
we wouldn't be having this conversation. The token is
meant to control me. I cannot exert my power to retrieve
it, and my power enlivens and encompasses my 'children'
who surround you."
"We could get this thing back for you, I'm guessing?"
"Another point for the human, and I thought you a
turgid thinker," said the voice. "Listen closely. My token
lies in a portion of this sprawling complex known as the
Sighing Vault. It lies not too far from here, no more than
a day of travel through Under-Tharos for those who stride
on two legs. My senses cannot penetrate too deeply, but
I can feel it lying at the center of the Sighing Vault. It
glows like a splinter in my mind, taunting me with its
closeness."
Ususi asked, "Is there anything you can tell us about
the Sighing Vault? Did the Nar wizards use it for safe-
keeping of their secrets, as the name implies?"
The blot bobbed, somehow miming a shrug with its
formless darkness. "The Vault has its guardians. Kill
them for me, and I'll be doubly grateful to you."
Elowen said, "We are already in the middle of a quest.
We don't have time for a distraction like this. These ruins
are mazelike. You could be sending us on a task that will
take days or months."
"Perhaps, but consider the alternative: I suck the life
out each and every one of you with a breath."
A coldness slipped then into Marrec's heart, ignoring
his clothing, his flesh, his will. It was a sentient hol-
lowness, burrowing into him. He fell, catching himself
against the cold ice of the slab containing the queen. The
pain of that chill contact was as nothing compared to
the blizzard of dissolution in his soul. Then, like a cat
186 . THE PRIESTS

--- Page 195 ---
removing its paw from a stunned mouse with which it
played, the cold vanished.
As he straightened, Marrec saw his friends begin to
rise, or uncurl, from fetal positions. All of them had re-
ceived the same treatment, simultaneously. Impressive.
Terrifying. They were completely in the queen's power.
"You won't be so foolish to refuse me, will you?"
Marrec cleared his throat, tried to answer. After a
moment, he tried again, "We might accept but die in the
attempt to retrieve your trinket."
Laughter. Then, "I'll take that chance. If I kill you,
then I'll never know, will I? So answer me. Do you agree
to find the token of my freedom, wrest it from the Sighing
Vault if you are able, and return it to me here?"
Gunggari gave him another shrug, shaky that time.
Ususi looked unsure, but she was still shuddering from
the queen's demonstration of her power.
Elowen said, "Why not, Marrec? Better to avoid this
fight, save our strength for the Talontyr."
"What does this token look like?" questioned Marrec.
"You'll know it when you see it, human."
"All right, majesty. You've got yourself a deal."
The voice thundered, "Excellent. My children, allow
our friends to depart, and you-" a tendril of darkness
separated from the blot in the ice, its tip wavering, then
pointing like an arrow toward one of the ice demon-"You!
You will accompany our new friends. Lead them to the
Sighing Vault. Make sure that they do not try to back out.
of our agreement."
The fiend indicated by the gesturing tendril coughed
something incoherent.
Marrec and his group then numbered five.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 187

'THE
RIESTS
CHAPTER 19
The chill faded as the Queen Abiding and her icy
court fell behind. An all-too-obvious reminder of
the visit was embodied in the monstrosity that
moved ahead, leading the way. The creature slid
along the broken masonry and loose earth of the
underground passage as if skating on the smooth
surface of a frozen lake.
No one said anything. Marrec was silently
grateful. Internally, he wondered if he had made
the right decision in dealing with the icy demon.
Perhaps they should have refused to find the
token for the Queen Abiding. Perhaps she had
somehow bluffed them all?
Perhaps, but what's done is done, mused the
cleric.
One good thing had come of his meeting with
the formless blot caught in the ice. By compari-
son with the queen's monstrosity, he wondered if

--- Page 197 ---
his own heritage was so terrible. The queen was to evil
like ice was to cold, inevitable. Marrec knew himself well
enough to determine that he had very little in common
with that creature.
They traveled down a path of tumbled pillars, un-
differentiated rubble, dark side passages, and gloomy
chambers, some empty, others filled with silhouettes of
alarming clutter. Strange sounds sometimes blew in from
these darkened alcoves, causing the group to pause.
On a few occasions wooden doors, improbably sound and
hardly rotted, proved to be barriers to forward progress,
but only until their frigid guide once again moved forward
to apply its hell-born brawn. Each such crash echoed away
into the maze-like tunnels; sometimes the last, faintest
echoes seemed to return, as if shaped into words or cries
like a beast, or even screams. No one commented on that
unsettling aspect of Under-Tharos, though Gunggari and
Marrec exchanged worried glances with each occurrence.
Neither was imagining the phenomena.
They broke out into a larger chamber. Stone obelisks
poked up through shattered flooring in random collec-
tions, like clumps of grass in a garden. Marrec could
detect no pattern to their arrangement. It seemed, indeed,
that they had grown from the earth, though they were
unmoving. Each obelisk was inscribed with cramped
symbols, visible even from a distance, because a faint
luminescence clung to the chisel marks.
Their demonic guide passed among the stones without
a glance. They followed, walking the winding route cho-
sen by their escort. Ususi threatened to loiter, her brows
wrinkled as she studied an obelisk, but Elowen cupped
the mage's elbow and urged her on. A dozen doors, all
stone, broke off the chamber to the right and left. Some
were cracked, others completely fallen and crumbling on
the floor, opening on lightless obscurity.
The chamber turned out to be more of a hall. The stone
obelisks grew fewer, but in their place were great iron
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 189

--- Page 198 ---
blades, rusted and crumbling. Like the earlier stones,
their arrangement seemed to follow no pattern the cleric
could discern. Some of the blades reached up, grazing the
high stone ceiling just visible in their light.
The hall finally reached its terminus at an arched
opening. Stone valves lay broken and crumbled around
the dark mouth. The demon skated past the fallen doors
and through the arch without a pause, and those he led
followed after.
Beyond was another hallway carved and dressed, but
damaged by time. The smooth walls of the original tun-
nel were tumbled and breached. Strewn about the floor
was loose rubble of the dilapidated hallway, bones, loose
teeth, and patches of hide. A low susurrus of blended
clicks, moans, and gurgles echoed from somewhere ahead.
The sounds, or perhaps the evidence on the floor of recent
habitation, gave the ice demon pause.
"What is it?" Marrec asked the demon, whispering.
The icy monster shrugged and said, "Never gone here be-
fore. Know the way, not the terrain, not the impediments."
"Are we even close?"
"Close. Maybe," responded the demon, before giggling.
"After you, then," urged Marrec, motioning the demon
ahead with his illuminated spear.
The demon giggled again then slid ahead. The thick
rubble was enough to cause it to raise its paws, pushing
off walls, and step over boulders. It was moving almost
like a natural quadruped. Almost.
A shape stepped out of the darkness directly into the
path of the demon. It was a misshapen humanoid with a
single horn upon its head. Great claws hung from its un-
gainly hands like infestations. Saliva ran from its tusks,
whetting its leathery hide.
The ice demon made to side-step the sudden obstacle,
but the newcomer, exploiting the demon's lack of response,
jumped onto the icy creature's back with an ear-piercing
howl of glee.
190 ⚫THE PRIESTS

attacker had become a blur of flashing arms and legs,
claws and teeth, tusks and spikes. Normally such an
exhibition would draw Marrec's eye, but not then.
With a clatter of claws and hooves, the remaining four
attackers surged forward.
Elowen engaged the foremost, Dymondheart pulsing
in her grip like the live thing it was. Her foe was dis-
mayed by the flashing green blade; a round-house slash
to its neck lopped off the creature's head before it could
lay a single claw upon her.
At her side, Gunggari wielded his war club, facing off
against two of the monsters simultaneously. His grip on
the length of his dizheri was fluid and shifting, allowing
him to attack with one hand then the other, sometimes
poking, other times spinning and bashing with the full
force of his extended arm and weapon length.
Marrec ran forward, screaming Lurue's name as a
battle cry. Justlance returned to him while he ran, and
he used it to stab one of the creatures facing Gunggari. It
pawed at him but continued to devil the Oslander.
"What are these things?" yelled Marrec.
Elowen ducked a clawed-tipped swipe of the last
attacker and yelled, "Ogres, maybe-crossbred with
something nastier."
The light shed from Justlance pierced the darkness fur-
ther, revealing two more of the "ogres." Slinking up quietly,
they roared as the light touched them and charged. Marrec
snagged one with his spear. The other flashed past.
He backpedaled, keeping the one he'd distracted busy
with Justlance's tip. Ususi was a powerful wizard but
fragile if undefended. Glancing back, he saw the wizard
trace a pattern in the air before shooting her assailant
through with sizzling bolts of fire. The monstrosity fell,
but its violent momentum tumbled the bleeding, smoking
body to within a foot of Ususi.
The two on Gunggari were working together, attempt-
ing to distract the tattooed warrior so that the other
192 ⚫ THE PRIESTS

--- Page 200 ---
could attempt a killing blow. Before Marrec could as-
sist, Elowen lunged sidewise with Dymondheart, which
strobed green for the tiniest moment. Where the blade
brushed one of Gunggari's attackers, the monster's hide
erupted in green flame. Screaming, the creature ran back
the way it had come, beating at its side. A heart beat later,
the Oslander dropped the other creature with a resound-
ing blow from his war club.
Only three creatures remained, one on Marrec, one on
Elowen, and the first and the largest still grappling with
their chaperone demon. The horned ogre seemed to be get-
ting the best of the fight. It was tearing away icy chunks,
burrowing like a rodent in loose earth.
The Oslander called out his cry to battle as he turned
and attempted to strike the horned ogre from the rear.
Before Gunggari's cry was fully formed, a clawed foot pis-
toned backward directly into Gunggari's neck. The man's
cry choked off, and he was down, unmoving.
Marrec could do nothing; his attacker was trying to
get past his whirling spear with its claw-tipped arms
flailing. He considered using his talent, then paused, hor-
rified that that particular thought would come so easily.
His opponent nearly knocked Marrec to the floor in the
cleric's distraction.
Yet another swarm of fiery strands erupted from
Ususi's fingers, striking Marrec's adversary before it
could finish off the human who stumbled before it.
Scratch one more horned ogre, thought Marrec, scram-
bling to his feet.
"Thanks, Ususi."
"I don't like debts outstanding," replied the wizard.
Glancing to his left, Marrec decided that Elowen had
her foe on the ropes. He dashed to Gunggari's side and
bent to check on him-still breathing but very hurt.
Marrec studied the battle, wondering if he should pull
Gunggari away from the flailing demon and horned ogre
or help their chaperone. It wouldn't bother him too much
BRUCE R. CORDELL 193

--- Page 201 ---
if their chaperone were slain. It was a demon after all....
Elowen finally pierced the defense of her foe. It
dropped, gushing something other than blood onto the
floor of the debris-strewn hallway.
Marrec decided to let queen's envoy and the attack-
ing monster fight without interference. He grabbed
Gunggari's satchel off the Oslander's belt, the one the
Nentyarch had provided. Rummaging through it, he
was surprised to note four vials, each labeled with a
name-Marrec, Gunggari, Elowen, and Ususi. Strange.
He'd have to ask Gunggari about that later. A moment
later his hand found a potent elixir of healing, as he'd
guessed he would.
Back before Lurue's presence had faded from his day
to day life, he had been able to brew similar miracles in a
vial. Someday, he vowed, he'd regain that connection, but
all he could do then was pour the pale blue contents down
Gunggari's throat. A convulsive wave suffused the un-
conscious man's body, visibly closing wounds as the flush
of health passed over his skin. Gunggari woke, coughed,
blinked, and was on his feet only a second later. It wasn't
the first time he'd been revived by magical resuscitation
at Marrec's hands.
In a sudden turn-around, the ice demon finally man-
aged to grasp its adversary's head between both of its
front claws, something it had been trying to do the whole
time. With the sound of crunching bone, the attacking
creature's head was crushed in an instant. The horned
ogre joined its brethren on the floor. The ice demon rose
slowly, chipped and less bulky than before but trium-
phant. It tittered. The sound prickled Marrec's spine.
It was then a brutish, hollow voice echoed from the
darkness. It said, "Lackey of she who is frozen in dark-
ness: be still!"
Their chaperone demon staggered as if struck, then
stood unmoving, frozen indeed, its icy body no longer
animate.
194 THE PRIESTS
•

--- Page 202 ---
"Who said that?" queried Ususi.
Marrec peered ahead, trying to ascertain the same
thing. He thrust his spear tip forward, trying to will
more light down the hallway.
Into the light came a shape. It was similar in form
to the horned ogres they'd faced, but it was far larger
and more sinister. A crown of horns protruded from its
head like barbs. They glowed with a light Marrec knew
instinctively was hellish. Marrec's face prickled with the
evil that pulsed away from the thing with steady beats,
like a heartbeat ringing up from the depths.
It spoke again, "The queen learns from her earlier
forays. She finally has the wit to send those other than
creatures I can command at my least whim. Still, it won't
avail her."
It ceased to speak, and took no other action but to stare
a challenge at them. That seemed a potent enough threat
to Marrec.
The cleric moved a step closer to the newcomer and ad-
dressed it, "We have no quarrel with you. Let us pass."
The monstrosity responded. "I disagree. I think; you do
have a quarrel with me, though you may not possess acu-
men enough to know it. You're traveling with one of the
queen's children. I presume you are on the errand she has
set them on so many previous occasions."
"What's that to you, creature?"
"If you are foolish enough to address me, mortal," said
the creature, "You will address me by my proper title, or
I'll sew your skin to my trophy tapestry out of turn. I am
called Eschar."
Marrec repeated, "Why do you care if we travelers do
the bidding of the Queen Abiding, Eschar?"
"Because," growled Eschar, "it is my task to guard
the approach to the Sighing Vault. This tunnel that you
transgress has only one destination. I'll grant you one
guess where that is."
Marrec could guess easily, but he tried to stretch out
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 195
.

--- Page 203 ---
the conversation further. "Your task? You mean, you're
bound here, same as the Queen Abiding, by some long-
dead Nar sorcerer's magic?"
Eschar said nothing, but the luminosity of his crown
of horns doubled. Marrec had to squint to look at the
creature.
Even had he an unfettered connection with Lurue,
Marrec doubted he would have had strength enough
to pray for a spell to banish demons directly out of the
world, but he was familiar with the task. That possibility
was out of the question. He knew that simply slaying the
creature would accomplish the same task, if he could but
manage it, but Marrec tried one more tack.
Marrec said, "Surely you have had time enough since
your binding to find a way to subvert the intent of your
original task. Let us through. Perhaps this last lapse will
break the age-long binding that holds you here."
The demon laughed then said, "You are full of assump-
tions, human. As a matter of fact, I quite like it here. I
am not bound quite so tightly as most of my brethren,
and may even walk freely for a time in the world above.
That is how I gained the Queen Abiding's token of con-
trol when the newcomer above at Dun Tharos's center
foolishly lost it.
"And," added the creature, shining with red delight,
"It's been far too long since I've been able to slake my
thirst. I think I'll rather enjoy sucking the meat of each
of your bones. I'll mount your skins in the Vault with the
others."
Gunggari, freshly healed, was following the conversa-
tion closely. When the crowned demon lunged forward as
he screeched the last portion of his speech, Gunggari was
ready with his dizheri. The Oslander sounded a great,
reverberating tone from his instrument of combat. The
sound crashed forth, almost visible in the red-lit tunnel,
its racing wave-front impacting the charging demon
before the creature moved more than ten feet. Marrec
196 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 204 ---
had seen that same trick lay out lesser creatures for
full minutes. It was sufficient to cause Eschar to pause,
growling.
"Gunny, Elowen, Ususi, take him out!" yelled Marrec.
He would have continued with more explicit direc-
tions, but the demon was suddenly next to him, somehow
standing over the cleric without having moved physically
through the intervening distance. Eschar tried to bite
him, but Marrec blocked just in time with Justlance.
Another bite, two feints, and a head-butt nested
with cruel horns-the cleric fell back with each attack,
keeping Justlance between himself and the demon. He
couldn't afford to return an attack. The creature was too
powerful, too strong. If Marrec opened up his defenses
with an attack of his own, he didn't doubt Eschar would
instantly expose Marrec's innards in a way sure to upset
his friends. A few more seconds, and Ususi was sure to
blast the creature...
A foot, dagger-clawed, streaked past his spinning
spear. The kick lifted him and sent him rolling back tens
of feet. The hard ground cudgeled him as he tumbled
along the tunnel, his hands momentarily empty of the
comforting haft of Justlance. Shadows narrowed his vi-
sion as his momentum was finally absorbed by the floor.
Justlance returned to his grip. The spear's return re-
minded him of the reason for the pain. He gasped and tried
to sit, using Justlance as a prop. Any additional effort
was beyond Marrec's power. Even his secret talent seemed
distant and unavailable as he sought for any weapon to
throw against the demon. He could only watch.
Gunggari was done with using his dizheri as an in-
strument; he gripped his weapon in both tattooed hands
and swung with a vengeance. The blows did little to slow
Eschar's fury.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 197

--- Page 205 ---
The elf hunter waded in, ready to try Dymondheart
against a foe mightier than any she had before faced. As
she closed on the demon, a light like the sun illuminated
her and her blade, as if the daylight above had decided to
ignore the intervening forest and rocky floor.
The demon flinched, focusing all its attention on
Elowen, and snarled, "You have a potent weapon. I think
I'll kill you before you figure out how to really use it."
A clawed hand flashed out, as if to pluck the blade from
Elowen's grasp, but she fell back, dragging the length of
Dymondheart across Eschar's extended forearm. Where
the blade touched, the skin peeled back, revealing an
inky blackness. Eschar howled.
With its unflayed arm, the demon formed a great fist
and pivoting its entire body, delivering a stunning hook
to the side of Elowen's head. The light surrounding Elow-
en flared up, became for an instant blinding, then faded
to nothingness. Elowen, Eschar, and Gunggari stood for
a moment, blinking, in the sudden return to near dark-
ness natural to the tunnel. Of them all, Elowen was most
surprised by her continued upright posture; by all rights,
she should be splattered across the tunnel wall.
Eschar growled, said, "Already learned a few things,
eh? Not enough!"
It lunged again, completely ignoring Gunggari, whose
efforts were becoming frenzied. Elowen brought up Dy-
mondheart; it seemed strangely dull and heavy. No light
played along its length. Whatever it had just done to save
Elowen from the demon's first blow had exhausted the
blade's elan.
Eschar didn't at first recognize Dymondheart's low-
ered vitality, and despite his tough words, he seemed
oddly tentative for such a hulking atrocity. The demon
threw just a few quick, probing attacks that Elowen
managed to deflect along the length of her disturbingly
heavy blade.
Eschar's single-minded attention on the elf hunter
198 ⚫THE PRIESTS

--- Page 206 ---
finally paid off for Gunggari. The tattooed warrior
wound up then swung, putting all the weight of his
body behind the blow. The edge of his dizheri connected
squarely under Eschar's jaw with a sound that could
only herald breaking bone. Eschar's scream was high
and piercing.
Ususi finally made her presence known, too. She had
studied the fight, trying to gauge which of her powers
might be most effective. Not completely unschooled in the
ways of demons, the wizard knew that evils as obviously
potent as Eschar were often resistant to magical attack.
What would blast a mortal foe into a stain of blood and
splintered bone might wash off a demon of Eschar's caliber
like rain.
She could change the environment itself with her
craft, which was something even powerful demons had
to contend with.
Ususi drew the Wand of Citrine Force, drawing a
glowing yellow symbol in the air. As she "inked" the last
stroke of the symbol, it pulsed once then sped unerringly
at Eschar. At the last second Eschar looked up, his eyes
widening, but the symbol was upon him. Moments before
touching the demon's flesh, the symbol flashed into a
thick, billowing puff of icy vapor. The demon tried to
backpedal, but the vapor enveloped him completely. An
instant later, the vapor froze solid, creating a disquieting,
asymmetrical block of yellow ice in which Eschar was
caught like a fly in amber.
The Queen Abiding wasn't the only demon bound by
cold below Dun Tharos.
Later, after Gunggari returned Marrec's earlier
healing by way of his Nentyarch-given satchel, Marrec
approached the block of ice.
"Where'd Eschar go?" he asked, his stomach tightening.
.
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 199

--- Page 207 ---
Everyone rushed over to look into the ice. A hollow
space cratered the center of the ice, but the exterior of
the block was unbroken. Eschar was no longer caught.
Ususi said, "He is a powerful demon. I could not bind
him spiritually, only physically. He has the power to
move himself from place to place; he said the same thing
earlier."
Elowen groaned. She said, "Does this mean we're going
to have to face that abyssal bastard again?"
Ususi responded, "If he continues to guard the Sighing
Vault, then yes. Eschar yet bars our way."

THE RIESTS
CHAPTER 20
Fallon worried. Doubt gnawed at him like a vicious
rodent, turning his stomach sour. All his dreams
of power, conquest, and comeuppance paid to his
fellows in Yeshelmaar had become pale things,
the goals a child might hold dear, not a man. As
he tramped on through the maze of ancient sum-
moning stones, senseless traps, and chambers
whose purpose he could not divine, the darkness
whispered only one thing to him. The message
was bleak: Fallon was a minor, expendable little
player in a drama that had little use for him once
his part was played.
The pain of the Rotting Man's touch also con-
tinued to plague him, making all his thoughts
slow and captious.
It hadn't been that way while he was under
Anammelech's wing. The blightlord had nur-
tured Fallon's tiny imaginings, coaxing petty

--- Page 209 ---
daydreams into an all-out betrayal. For some reason,
Fallon had believed that the promised rewards would
make it all worth while. That shroud of comforting be-
lief had been stripped from his eyes by his contact with
the Talontyr.
Fallon was no fool. At least, he didn't like to think so.
Perhaps Anammelech had just as little use for him, but
fed Fallon's ego merely to bring him more fully into the
camp of Dun Tharos. The coin the blightlord paid the elf
for his reports of the doings in the Nentyarch's court was
also head-turning.
It all had come to this. He had a date with a servitor
of an evil goddess. He wondered how he could have ever
been such a fool.
Sliding between sleeping demons and past the defenses
of ancient Nar conjuries didn't aid his disposition. Fallon
was a skipping stone and Under-Tharos the water; he
could sense the ever broadening wake he left behind; his
and Ash's rapid passage enlivened defenses long dormant
and woke creatures trapped for centuries in deathless
slumber. Doors that gaped open and unmoving allowed
him unrestricted access, but after he passed, he could
hear echoes as they slammed shut, as if embarrassed
they had allowed his unrestricted passage so easily, de-
termined not to make the same mistake twice. He didn't
fully understand why the doors, the yawning traps, and
the slumbering horrors were not already energized.
Perhaps it was the doing of the Talontyr, whose power
had reached out and calmed the surface in preparation
for the elf's passage. Once past, the calm broke. As long
as Fallon could keep skipping ahead of the storm, he re-
mained safe.
He supposed Elowen and her sad crew were even then
meeting the first of the things he had aroused with his
passage. At least he could take some small comfort in
knowing that his pursuers would fall ever further behind
and probably be slain outright in the bargain. Of course,
202 - THE PRIESTS

--- Page 210 ---
they were merely trying to do what was right, a course he
had abandoned long ago to his present detriment. It oc-
curred to him that morals might have more behind them
than mere 'happiness and light.'
He gripped Ash's hand again, pulling the child along
behind. As always, she gave no resistance. She never cried,
or for that matter, even bruised. A pang of guilt, unfamil-
iar, assailed him. Didn't he care about the unresponsive
child and her eventual fate, likely horrifying? Later, if he
had a minute to spare, he would investigate that feeling,
despite its sudden unwelcome appearance, but he had to
spend all his effort on staying ahead of the waking wave
behind him. He worried that his wave of disruption would
crest, and finally catch him up before he made it all the
way through.
He considered the shape he'd seen in the very first
chamber, a shape caught in the ice. He gagged then shud-
dered when he recalled a single eye opening way back in
the cold, before he turned tail and fled deeper.
A luminescence he had only half noted earlier was
growing stronger as he approached. It had a pale, green,
washed out look to it, as if the light were somehow weary.
Its light was stronger than the radiance provide by his
hooded lantern.
"That's worrying," he said aloud to Ash. The light was
the first he'd seen since entering Under-Tharos. He won-
dered if something had awakened ahead of him.
He turned to the girl. "You know, maybe we ought to
reconsider our path, eh? I wonder if I just ran for the
surface now..."
29
Without warning, the pain in Fallon's head spiked.
He cried aloud, clutching at his head, stumbling, send-
ing his lantern tumbling. It was like a fire raged behind
his eyes. His mind was on fire. He could feel his will to
resist, his personality, his very essence begin to smolder
in metaphorical heat.
He grunted, squeezing his forehead all the harder,
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 203

--- Page 211 ---
trying to wring the pain away. The pain redoubled. The
realization struck Fallon that the impetus implanted by
the Rotting Man was more than mere direction; it was a
malicious presence intent on hollowing him out from the
inside, leaving a physical husk, a husk capable of accom-
plishing only tasks set for it by the Talontyr.
"No, leave me my mind!" he screamed, but as relent-
lessly as the tide receding, his personality crumbled
under the repeated hammer strikes from within.
Memories of his upbringing at the hands of his kind
sires flared and died. His time spent in training as a
hunter under the cool green leaves crumbled. His brief
love for an elven maid of surpassing beauty was stripped
from him. What had she told him? "Oh, but for the piece of
my heart you have stolen with your tender kisses..." No,
it was gone; he couldn't remember. Weeping at his loss, the
knowledge even that his memory was crumbling began to
flame and wither. His first contacts by Anammelech, who
seemed so innocent at first, and all his later betrayals spi-
raled into darkness. Everything was taking on a burning
redness where there was no room any longer for what had
once called itself Fallon.
Then came something new.
Amidst the scarlet flames, a point of pure white light
glimmered. With the white light came surcease from
the agony and a foothold against the erosion of Fallon's
mind. The white light grew, faster and faster, and where
it touched the pain was extinguished. Fallon felt his per-
sonality shuffling back from the precipice to which it had
been forced. Finally, the attack ceased, and with it the
pain broke. The compulsion was defeated.
There was Ash, standing closer than she had before.
The girl rested the back of her hand lightly against
Fallon's forehead. Then she pulled back, a glimmer of
interest in her eyes gradually dulling back to their cus-
tomary somnolence.
The child's touch had saved him.
204 THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 212 ---
When his strength was recovered, Fallon considered
his options. The pain was completely gone. His mind
was made whole again. In the aftermath of the Rotting
Man's treachery and in the face of his salvation at Ash's
intercession, the elf decided it was time to think about
his future.
He would abandon his instructions from the Rotting
Man. He would reverse himself, despite all the steps he'd
taken, each step stretching back in tiny increments, in
sum sufficient to propel him to where he sat, back propped
up against some forgotten Nar tomb, the child he had kid-
napped sitting nearby, and a foul green light from the
corridor ahead painting everything a sickening shade.
What could be the consequence of one more bond
broken when he had already severed his loyalty to the
noble Nentyarch? Fear of the Rotting Man's displeasure
couldn't be discounted, but Fallon had a hard time imag-
ining what the Rotting Man could do to him that was
worse than what had just been attempted. Losing himself
was more than the elf could bear. The Rotting Man had
miscalculated, or more likely, the Rotting Man hadn't
known that the child had the capacity to neutralize his
foul power.
Where could he go now? He couldn't go back through
the hallways and dark passages from which he'd come.
He'd alerted too many ancient horrors, rattled the cages
of too many bound demons dating back to Narfell's pre-
eminence. To turn back into the face of that storm would
be little different than acceding to the Rotting Man's
desires. Either way, he was sure he'd end up dead and his
soul forfeit in the bargain.
If he couldn't go back, he'd have to go forward, but too
straight a path would deliver him into the Rotting Man's
hands. Actually, he recalled that a blightlord had been
dispatched to meet him. Damanda. If he stayed on his
BRUCE R. CORDELL
•
205

--- Page 213 ---
present course, his meeting with her would occur within
the day.
He'd have to strike off in a direction of his own
choosing-a scary thought. The dungeons of Under-
Tharos were legendary, both for their demonic contents
and their extensive size, but perhaps he could scent a
passage to the surface.
"You ready to get out of here, girl?" Fallon asked the
child, his voice gentler than was his wont. "I'd give a lot
to see the sun again."
He stood. The lantern he'd dropped had miraculously
not broken nor even leaked too much; it was of Ye-
shelmaar make after all. It didn't take but a moment to
pick it up. Taking Ash's hand, he turned down a dark side
passage to the left that was not marked in his mind.
The green light from down the wide corridor flickered
wildly, as if in the throes of a tantrum. After a time, the
emerald light returned to its originally sickly hue, wait-
ing, or more properly described, lurking.

CHAPTER 21
Elowen
I ran a finger down the length of Dymond-
heart. The blade still seemed sluggish. Light
failed to ripple along its length as it had when
she'd first unsheathed it. She worried the vigor
it held before would not return.
"Should we press on or rest?" asked Marrec.
The cleric stood peering down the passage which
they all believed opened on the Sighing Vault.
Elowen sheathed her blade, hoping her worry
was unfounded.
"We should rest," snapped Ususi. "I've depleted
my energies too much today and need time to pre-
pare myself, especially if we must face Eschar
once more."
Marree nodded at the mage.
The tattooed southlander said, "The demon is
retreating. We should press our advantage and
pursue it immediately."

--- Page 215 ---
Elowen spoke up, "We barely faced it down here. If
Ususi is tapped, I doubt our ability to face it again."
As she spoke, she rested her hand protectively along
Dymondheart's sheath.
Marrec rubbed his forehead and said, "Time's not on
our side. Fallon could be hours away from delivering Ash
to his bastard of a master."
"If he hasn't already," opined Ususi.
Marrec regarded her with a sour look then said, "We've
got to finish our business with the queen as quickly as
possible, so we can move on to what's really important."
"Do we?" asked Gunggari. He approached their
demonic chaperone, which remained immobile since
Eschar's command. Gunggari nudged it with the edge of
his dizheri. It failed to respond.
"Well, we did make a deal..." began Marrec.
"With a demon!" interrupted Ususi. "Don't you think
this queen, whatever her true infernal name, will bend or
break our bargain at the very first opportunity?"
Marrec stated, "Two wrongs do not a right make."
Ususi threw up her hands. "You can't 'wrong' a demon."
Elowen tried to deflect what seemed a mounting
argument, holding up one hand. "The Rotting Man is
more powerful, surely, than either Eschar or the Queen
Abiding."
"So, what, we have no chance? Is that your point?"
sniped Ususi.
"No..."
"Her point," said Gunggari, still poking at the unmov-
ing ice demon, "is that we may find an ally in the queen
if we release her. Right?" Gunggari grinned at the elf, his
teeth improbably white against his dark skin.
"Almost," responded Elowen. "Like Ususi says, we can't
forget the Queen Abiding is a fiend, and fiends cannot
be trusted, but this demon is desperate. Who knows how
many thousands of years she's been trapped down here
in these ruins? If she wasn't desperate, certainly she
208 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 216 ---
wouldn't have arranged for creatures not completely
under her control to find and bring to her the one item,
which apparently has the ability to control her actions."
Gunggari nodded slowly. Marrec adopted a consider-
ing look; Ususi frowned.
"I propose," continued Elowen, "that before we return
this token to the queen, we avail ourselves of its power.
We use the queen to bolster our strength against the
Rotting Man, through her token of control."
Ususi, still frowning, said, "A tool such as this can turn
in its owner's hand. It would be too risky,"
"Don't talk to me about risky," snorted Elowen. "This de-
mon had us at her mercy and forced us to agree to retrieve
her trinket. That was risky. Merely being in Under-Tharos
is a risk most would never countenance. Sure it's a risk to
try to force the queen's aid, but if she can be redeemed in
any way, she can do some good for a change, even if it is
against her nature. This token gives us the edge we need
and should provide us a margin of safety that mere agree-
ments, backed up only by word, lack."
"There is risk; there is such a thing as a soul hazard,"
said Ususi.
Gunggari noted, "Ususi, certainly you've heard tell of
evil creatures who occasionally do the work of good?"
Elowen noticed that Marrec colored slightly at Gung-
gari's words. The Oslander had struck a nerve somehow,
but she didn't know why.
Gunggari continued, "If we are to foil the Rotting
Man's plan, renew Lurue, and survive to tell the tale,
we'll need help. The queen may be all we have."
Ususi frowned but said nothing further.
Elowen grinned, said, "Great. Let's see about getting
our chaperone out of his fugue, then, shall we?"
Ususi looked at Marrec, waiting. The cleric shook his
head but said, "Free the ice demon if you can, Ususi."
Ususi uttered a quick word under her breath, but she
began to mutter and scribe runes on the dark surface
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 209

of the unmoving ice demon. The cleric stood nearby, his
eyes narrowed, apparently having some sort of internal
debate as he watched the wizard work.
Elowen considered Marrec.
She rarely understood humans, but she had known
elves similar to Marrec, dutiful, but at turns playful;
often vocal, but sometimes taciturn. The cleric's devotion
to his absent goddess verged on a lover's attention for his
cherished bride, which struck Elowen as a bit disturbing,
though she'd seen it in others. In Marrec, whose goddess
no longer daily bolstered him with contact and clarity of
purpose, the devotion ran the risk of becoming merely a
sad habit of thought. Of course, if they were successful,
perhaps that would all change, as the Nentyarch had
hinted.
Ususi had mentioned to her while they walked the
tunnels of Under-Tharos that Marrec had admitted to
some secret talent, though the human was somehow
ashamed of it. That latest bit of gossip was most intrigu-
ing. She wondered if she'd get the chance to see Marrec
show his ability forth.
The passage was blocked ahead.
A pale stone face jutted from the wall. The face was
massive; the tunnel passage was just large enough to
contain it. The face seemed human but wrenched with
devilish glee; at least it seemed to be leering. It was much
eroded by water, and stalactites dripped from its cheek-
bones and brows. The face's mouth was wide open, and
its tongue, also crumbling stone, lolled out like a carpet.
The mouth was stopped up with an iron door, rusted and
stained black. A single pull-ring hung from the door's
center. To Marrec's eyes, the door appeared as if it had
been closed for centuries.
Marrec asked Gunggari, "Did we get off the track?"
210 . THE PRIESTS

--- Page 218 ---
The tattooed warrior shook his head, saying, "No,
Eschar came from this way. See? These rust-flakes on
the ground show the door has been only recently closed,
abruptly."
"Doesn't he magically flit around down here?"
Ususi answered from behind, "He may only have lim-
ited range."
The cleric supposed he could see a couple of flakes. He
trusted Gunggari to be right. Time was wasting, and they
had to move. "Then that's where we are going, too." He
walked up to the door, laid hold of the ring, and pulled.
"Wait!" yelled Elowen, at the same time as Ususi,
though the mage was less polite in her request than the
elf.
The door didn't budge despite his effort. He wished that
the gloves given him by the Nentyarch weren't drained.
"I said, wait," said Elowen, at his shoulder, pulling him
back. "We have to watch for traps."
Marrec shrugged, irritable. "Eschar went this way.
Beyond lies the Sighing Vault."
"Not precisely true," intoned Ususi from further back,
who had moved the opposite direction of Elowen when
Marrec tried the door. "If there is a vault, we may have to
run a gauntlet of protections to get to its center."
Marrec's face reddened. He could not justify his un-
thinking action, pulling on the door so recklessly, so he
said nothing.
Gunggari finally noted, "This door, at least, appears to
be free of defenses, but it is stuck."
"Give me a hand here, Gunny," requested Marrec. He
and the Oslander both heaved on the metal door. It didn't
even creak, though both men groaned with the effort.
Something cold and odiferous shouldered him out of
the way. Gunggari, similarly jostled, danced back and
grasped his dizheri; the ice demon had slid up silently
while their attention was on the door. Ususi had managed
to free it from its compulsion of inaction.
•
BRUCE R. CORDELL 211

Their icy chaperone reared back, its paw-like hands
balled into great fists. With a grand release, the fists
swung and smashed square into the center of the iron
door. The door blew off its hinges with a screech of metal,
a shower of sparks, and a clamorous crash of metal on
stone. The sound continued to echo up and down the cor-
ridor for several seconds before dying away.
Marrec said, "Our guide may prove more useful than
I had supposed."
The creature leered and giggled at Marrec.
"No doubt about it," agreed Elowen.
Marrec felt his attitudes shifting alightly. "We can't
keep calling you 'creature;' what is your name?" Marrec
asked the queen's envoy.
The beast considered then rasped, "The Victorious
Slayer of Compassion."
"We'll call you
Victoricus for short," responded Marrec
without losing a beat.
The creature didn't react to the cleric's simplification
of its name, except to cough up a phlegm-coated chunk of
stained ice, but it did that sometimes.
Marrec shoved his spear through the opening of the
mouth of the great bust. The eldritch glow on the spear's
tip illuminated the chamber beyond.
The square space revealed was covered in gray, peeling
plaster. Across the width of the room was an unlit exit,
but in between, the plaster that had not crumbled was
covered in paintings strangely bright and vivid. Scenes,
figures, and glyphs adorned the room in no apparent or-
der. The visual jumble covered the walls but also the floor
and ceiling, creating a disquieting mosaic of disturbing
images: a dragon eating a virginal maiden, a plague of
worms infesting a screaming man, a seascape where a
great tentacled monstrosity pulled down a ship, a giant
roasting bound prisoners on a spit...
Marrec looked away, disgusted. He studied the room,
trying not to focus on the painted scenes. Nothing moved,
212 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 220 ---
and nothing stirred in the empty exit. Crumbling plaster
lay in clumps and drifts across the floor, thankfully ob-
scuring some of the images.
"This way," said the cleric. He didn't like the look of
the preternaturally bright images. He said, "Try to step
only on the crumbled plaster." He followed his own advice,
treading carefully, sometimes jumping from one island of
powdery gray dust to the next.
Victoricus followed Marrec. The demon surprised the
cleric by following his direction, instead of sliding across
the room as Marrec had expected. Perhaps the demon was
bound to serve him? More likely, it knew something about
the images in the plaster that it hadn't divulged.
Gunggari followed, then Ususi, and last Elowen. As
Gunggari reached the bare stone hallway where Marrec
and the demon waited, Ususi reached the center of the
chamber. The mage paused.
"That's interesting," said Ususi, looking at a collec-
tion of arcane sigils that painted the floor near her feet.
"These are Nar characters, but the alphabet is strangely
reminiscent of Imaskari letters."
"Interesting, but not important now," opined Elowen,
right behind the mage, "Let's go."
"Just a moment," said Ususi, as she bent and touched a
finger to one the glyphs, tracing its lines.
"Oh, shards," breathed the wizard, then she yelled, "It's
got me!"
It was true. Where her finger had touched the image,
a meniscus of paint stretched to maintain contact. It did
more than stretch; it pulled. Ususi was yanked forward,
her finger, her hand, and her forearm swallowed into
the floor. It was as if the ground were a voracious liquid,
not hard plaster. Elowen caught at Ususi's other flailing
hand and the mage's forward momentum into the floor
was arrested.
Marrec, standing on the other edge, saw that where the
wizard's arm disappeared into the floor, new color sprang
BRUCE R. CORDELL 213

--- Page 221 ---
to life. It was as if a new painting were rising up from the
floor, there all along, but only then becoming visible. So
far, it revealed only a feminine arm, which terminated
at the point where Ususi knelt, struggling to pull herself
from the floor's grip.
"Pull her out of there," yelled Marrec. "It's eating her,
or... or something."
The cleric hustled back into the chamber, determined
to remain only on the mounds of crumbled plaster.
Because of his, the demon's, and Gunggari's earlier tra-
versal, the mounds were somewhat scattered, and it was
more difficult for him to get across quickly without
touching the painted floor.
"Gods, it's got a grip on her," complained Elowen, her
voice tight, as she pulled on Ususi's other arm. If any-
thing, she lost ground, and Ususi was pulled forward,
nearly her entire arm swallowed, her straining head
falling dangerously close to the absorptive surface.
Marrec arrived, clamped both his hands on the free
arm, lending his strength to Elowen's. They both heaved.
Ususi groaned as her bones crackled with the strain.
With a sucking pop, they pulled the wizard clear. All
three of them very nearly stumbled and fell backward,
but in the end they managed to retain their footing on
the crumbled plaster.
Breathing hard, his hand still on Ususi's arm, Marrec
murmured, "Come on." He led Ususi across. Elowen fol-
lowed after. They assembled safely on the opposite side of
the painted chamber.
Ususi turned to Marrec, "That is another life I owe
you."
A smile ghosted his lips in return. "I'm glad I'm build-
ing up credit. I may need to call in that marker before we
get clear of the Vault."

THE
RIESTS
CHAPTER 22
Fallon had failed to keep the schedule. Damanda
tapped midnight black nails on lacquered armor
just as dark. Green highlights played along
her silhouette. The fluctuating emerald glow
emerged from an ominous point further down
the ruined hallway where Damanda and her
retinue stood.
The pulsing, ravenous glow was the light of
the Lurker in the Middle, and by its intensity,
it was clear the entity had not snared Fallon. It
was still hungry. Damanda, for all her might,
had no desire to meet the Lurker face to face-or
whatever passed for a Lurker's face.
Fallon's absence was troubling. The Rotting
Man's compulsion should have cored the elf's
mind and marched him dutifully into the Lurk-
er's grasp, leaving the idiot child for Damanda
to collect at her leisure. No child, no Fallon, no

triumphant return to the Close with the Talontyr's hard-
sought prize in tow.
Worry puckered tentative steps across her stomach. It
did not do to disappoint the Rotting Man. His plans were
coming to fruition. She doubted she could survive being
a barrier to his goal, intentional or not.
That's why she would not fail, despite Fallon's trou-
bling absence.
The blightlord considered her retinue. Anammelech
had preferred oozes, and bumbling Gameliel his cor-
rupted forest creatures. Herself, she had a penchant for
the undead, especially those that delighted haunting
the night-and the ever dark corridors of these ruined
Nar conjuries. From all the cold, animate servants she
had to choose from, she had selected her four favorites to
accompany her into Under-Tharos to collect Fallon, just
in case there was trouble. Indeed, trouble had found her.
They would have to discover Fallon's whereabouts.
Heavily tattooed, poem-spewing Bonehammer rested
on the shaft of the weapon from which he derived his
name. Bonehammer's moon-white skin peeked out from
between indelibly inked scenes of depraved obscenity. His
blank eyes regarded the Lurker's glow, measuring.
Absalme, elf thin, gowned in thin white leather,
hummed a tuneless dirge, awaiting Damanda's next com-
mand. Her fingers played along the length of a flute of
fused humanoid vertebrae.
The contorted, constantly twisting frame of Ezekial was
draped in dull black cloth, hiding the extent of his defor-
mity. Because of his nature, Ezekial's posture hid a secret
assassin's strength, redoubled by his deathless spirit.
Finally there was diminutive Lex with her tomes,
scrolls, and wands. A shock of purple hair grew like fun-
gus on Lex's graceful skull.
Lex grinned, showing her cruelly pointed canines,
and said, "Some other demon got your elf before he even
reached here, eh?"
216 ⚫THE PRIESTS

--- Page 224 ---
"Perhaps. It is what we must discover. Ezekial!"
"Yes, Mistress?" creaked he of cloaks, daggers, and
teeth.
"Find the missing elf, or better yet, the girl-child he
has with him."
Ezekial bent, so precipitously and shockingly that
those unused to his contortions might have thought that
he had broken and his top half toppled. His nose a mere
whisper above the floor, he began to sniff. Sniffing, he
shuffled away from the greenish light, back along the
way Fallon should have come.
Damanda and the other vampires followed.

THE RIESTS
CHAPTER 23
Cracks riddled the stone walls of the passage.
Over the eons, trickling water had nearly dis-
solved away some sections, though a lingering
malign influence restricted the damage from
being total.
Marrec pressed forward, hoping to come to
the core of the Sighing Vault, but paranoid that
each new shadow hid an ambush by Eschar. His
companions stepped cautiously behind him, Vic-
toricus bringing up the rear.
Ususi had bolstered the ice demon with magic
that should make it more resistant to instant
neutralization by Eschar. That would be impor-
tant were they to face Eschar again.
Echoes of their footsteps sometimes leaped
ahead, causing Marrec to pause suspiciously.
Marrec said, "There is an open area ahead by the
sound of it." Whispers of his voice echoed back.

--- Page 226 ---
They pressed ahead, and the corridor emptied into
a vast space. Shapes glowed with their own foul light,
tumbled under a great subterranean ceiling. Pale domes,
cracked sarcophagi, and possibly thousands of clay ves-
sels, earthenware containers, and other containers lay
scattered and broken around the chamber, most half
buried in millennial dust. It was impossible to tell how
many thousands more containers lay completely buried.
Even the slightest sound sent echoes scurrying and
whispering across the chamber.
Victoricus intoned, "The Sighing Vault."
Ususi asked, "How can we find the token amidst this
morass? It would take years."
"I smell it," the ice demon said, almost as if surprised.
It began to slide forward, passing the outermost ves-
sels of the gargantuan pile. Casual inspection showed
that the chests, vessels, and pots that were broken were
empty of all content.
"Stay alert," said Marrec, gripping Justlance. "Eschar's
got to be here, waiting." He followed on the demon's heels.
Gunggari followed him, next Ususi, and Elowen took up
the rear, guarding their flank.
They passed out into the great cavern, passing be-
tween larger vessels of stone and iron so large that
they were like windowless, doorless buildings. Narrow
"streets" of clear space wound through that city of silence,
and Victoricus followed one such lane to the center of the
tumbled pile.
Some of the vessels where carved with faces, bodies,
skulls, demonic glyphs, and more depraved symbology. It
was clear that many Nar treasures and secrets resided
there in their hundreds.
Marrec said quietly, "Eschar's been a busy collector
over the centuries."
Ususi responded, "That or he happened upon a dump-
ing ground of failed Nar experiments. I doubt there is
much of any use here. I can't detect any magic in any of
BRUCE R. CORDELL .219

--- Page 227 ---
these." She waved her hand over a field of crooked, half-
shattered clay pots.
"Looking for goodies?" wondered Marrec.
"I'm looking for anything that we can use to our ad-
vantage," huffed the wizard.
Ahead of Marrec, Victoricus slid to a halt before a salt-
white dome. They had traveled several hundred yards,
picking their way through the vault field, and Marrec
decided they might well be in the center of the cavern.
The ice demon pointed to the vault and said, "The
Queen Abiding's token lies within."
Apprehensive that Eschar was watching them, so close
to their goal, they spread out around the dome, looking for
a door, window, or even a crack large enough to provide
entry. The dome, like many of the smaller containers
surrounding it, seemed sealed but unbroken. As far as
Marrec could determine, the dome was carved of a single
piece of limestone.A line of symbols ran around the pe-
riphery of the dome. That was all.
Dissatisfied with the time they were spending, Marrec
grunted, "I suppose these are in the language of ancient
Narfell?" He pointed to the symbols. He couldn't under-
stand why Eschar hadn't already attacked them. His neck
hair continually prickled, but no threat materialized to
justify his tension. Yet.
Ususi studied the symbols. She read, translating,
"Once for the First; Twice for the Archduke; Thrice for
the Viscount; Four revolutions for the dual lords; Five for
the Prince, Six for the Hag; Seven for the Seventh; Eight
for the Eighth, and Nine for the King."
"That doesn't sound like a healthy litany," noted
Elowen, looking around nervously.
"It does have the sound of a summoning, doesn't it,"
mused Ususi.
"Is it?" asked Marrec.
but
The wizard shrugged, said, "I do not believe so, no,
it does remind me of something." She pulled upon the
220 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 228 ---
flaps of one of her voluminous side satchels in which she
carried various slim tomes and parchments covered in
crabbed runes, sorted through the contents, then pulled
forth a slender volume bound in blue leather. The edges
were crumbling, and the symbols were faded, though they
seemed similar to those on the dome.
Ususi explained, "This tome is banned in some cities
of Faerûn, if you can believe it. Some people don't under-
stand that to fight demons and devils you have to first
recognize them."
Marrec's eyes widened. He asked, "You carry a tome of
demonology?"
The wizard said, "I carry many bits of knowledge. You
never know when you'll stumble upon something better
left alone, but how would you know it, unless you can
identify it as such? Ah hah!" her finger, scanning lines,
stabbed at an entry.
Ususi said, "The writing on the dome refers to the
Lords of Hell itself."
All stood silent a moment, digesting the mage's pro-
nouncement. Finally Marrec said, "So... what now? Are
we dealing with something far beyond our ability? A gate
straight into Hell? I hate these damned Nar sorceries."
"I'm not sure, but I suspect it is a riddle, merely play-
ing with the names of Hell. If we can answer the riddle,
I predict we can open the dome and reveal the queen's
token, along with whatever else Eschar stores here."
"And Eschar himself, no doubt," muttered Gunggari.
"Hold on; why devils?" asked Marrec. "Aren't the Nar
known for the demons they kept in thrall?"
Ususi replied, "Demons, devils, 'loths... the Nar were
not picky in those creatures they pressed into service. We
say demons, but the Nar embraced a much wider swath
of foulness."
Elowen wondered, "These devils are called the First,
the Second, and so on?"
"Yes, well, that is only part of their name. For instance,
BRUCE R. CORDELL .221

--- Page 229 ---
a devil named Bel is Lord of the First. The Lord of the
Second is Dispater."
Marrec studied the dome for any activity following the
utterance of the names. Nothing visibly changed. He said,
"You said something about revolutions. Does that have
something to do with the position of the moons around
Faerûn?" Marrec was rightfully proud of his astronomi-
cal knowledge.
"Maybe, but that would severely limit the times Es-
char could get into his centermost atash," said Ususi.
"Though he can flit into and out of spaces magically,"
noted Gunggari.
Ususi nodded but said, "Let's try this-walk around
the dome nine times. During each 'revolution' I'll call out
the name of a lord of Hell, from the First to the Ninth."
Elowen said, "That seems a little simple."
Ususi frowned.
Marrec said, "I'm not sure I want to traipse through
some ritual that involves the naming of devils."
The wizard said, "It's the only way to gain entry, unless
it doesn't work, of course."
Marrec finally nodded.
Once they gathered together, two by two, including
chilly Victoricus, they began to walk, counterclock-
wise. A wide space in the earth surrounding the dome
seemed to provide an ideal path. The mage walked in
the lead, holding her slim blue tome open to the list of
fiendish names, purportedly the names of the nine lords
of Hell.
Just before they finished their first circuit, Ususi
called out, "Bel, Lord of the First!"
Marrec couldn't see any change, but they continued
to walk.
On their second pass, Ususi cried, "Archduke Dispater,
Lord of the Second!"
The third time around, the mage called, "Viscount
Mammon, Lord of the Third!"
•
222 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 230 ---
Small bits of dust puffed up from various parts of the
vaultfield surrounding the dome.
Ususi called, "Lady Fierna and Archduke Belial,
Lords of the Fourth!" on the fourth circular trip.
The cavern rolled slightly, as if in the grip of a slight
tremor.
"You know, this could work," said Elowen.
Next, "Prince Levistus, Lord of the Fifth," then "The
Hag Countess, Lord of the Sixth!"
Following that sixth revolution a wind picked up,
blowing dust and grit into the air across the cavern. Mar-
rec gripped Justlance apprehensively as the visibility
worsened.
They continued through their seventh circuit. Vis-
ibility fell to nothing as the wind whipped up more
fiercely. Ususi named "Archduke Baalzebul, Lord of the
Seventh."
Groans and cries, screeches and howls broke out af-
ter Ususi named "Mephistopheles, Lord of the Eighth."
Something bit Marrec on the ankle, but when he looked,
nothing was there. They all hurried through the final
circuit.
Ususi, her voice hoarse from the dust, finally said
"King Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells!" Marrec itched
to plug his ears, afraid to sully his mind with names he'd
prefer not to know.
Just like that the dust pulled back as if a veil drawn
aside. Marrec exclaimed, "That's new!" as they came
around the dome for the ninth and last time.
A door-sized opening pierced the dome's side, looking
for all the world as if it had always been there, and from
the doorway issued a shape.
The forward-protruding crown of horns on its forehead
preceded its slavering mouth and lupine body. As before,
the sense of evil surrounding Eschar was palpable, at
least to Marrec who, as a servant of Lurue, had some ex-
perience in confronting otherworldly malevolence.
BRUCE R. CORDELL

--- Page 231 ---
Eschar pointed at Victoricus as it had before, saying
"Be still!"
Victoricus shuddered. Yellow light flickered across
its form, but instead of freezing, Victoricus tittered and
charged the horned demon.
Ususi breathed, "My protection held."
Victoricus smashed into Eschar like an icy fist. Eschar
shuddered but weathered the charge. Their chaperone's
cold claws left great rents down Eschar's face and side.
Elowen charged in, her living sword strangely dull.
Where she scored hits on the horned demon, no blood was
drawn. Eschar laughed, almost as if slightly relieved. He
continued to focus his attention on Victoricus, obviously
more afraid of the servant of the Queen Abiding than all
of the rest of them.
Gunggari came up on the demon's left, wielding his
dizheri. He landed a few hearty blows.
Marrec used Gunggari's distraction to launch Just-
lance straight and true. It penetrated Eschar's side. The
demon let loose a roar of such intensity that it ruined the
spell Ususi had been incanting.
"Enough," muttered Eschar.
His foul breath, already hot, became a flame in truth.
The coiling, white-hot fire focused itself on Victoricus,
who made as if to turn, maybe to run. They would never
know; when the flame touched their chaperone, its body
flashed instantly from ice directly to steam, foregoing
liquid. A black mist whirled away, leaving only a damp
stain on the cavern floor.
Marrec held forth his hand, waiting for Justlance to
return. Instead, Eschar plucked the bloodied spear from
its side. The demon shouldn't have been able to do that.
He shouldn't... his spear flashed back through the air,
arrowing for Marrec's heart. He fell forward, trying to
dive, but simply tripped. The tip of Justlance scored the
back of his armor.
Ususi was beside him. She said, "Get inside the dome
•
224 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 232 ---
and get the token. Command the queen to aid us. We'll
distract this whoreson of the Nine Hells."
So saying, she shot a narrow beam of energy directly
into Eschar's eyes. It caused the demon, which had
grabbed Elowen by one leg and begun squeezing, to cry
out and loose the elf. It clapped both hands to its eyes,
rubbing furiously while continuing to bellow.
Marrec used the moment to slip past Eschar into the
dome.
Elowen's leg bled freely where Eschar had squeezed
with its clawed hands. She saw Marrec slip past while the
demon continued to rub its eyes. Time to provide further
distraction.
She darted to the demon's left, at the same time drawing
Dymondheart along the inside of her foe's overlarge knee.
The living bladed sliced deep through tendon and sinew.
Had her own leg not pained her so, she wondered if she
could not have ended the fight right there, but hampered
as she was, she had to settle for what she could get. Eschar's
new scream of pain seemed a good reward.
Then Elowen noted that the tissue was reknitting,
disappearing before her eyes. She yelled to Gunggari to
her left, "His wounds are healing!"
Gunggari, who continued to batter the demon, seem-
ingly to little effect, scowled more deeply. At the very
least, he was keeping the demon off balance with the
force he imparted with each blow.
Its eyes finally clearing from Ususi's magical blast,
the demon glanced at Elowen then kicked her. She fell
into a bed of small clay vessels that were half-buried in
ash. Her mouth filled with a sharp, metallic taste as she
choked on the cloud of dust her flailing body fountained
into the air. Blinking her eyes to clear them, she looked
up to see that Eschar stood over her. The demon must
BRUCE R. CORDELL 225
.

--- Page 233 ---
have decided to be done with her once and for all.
Gunggari jostled and vibrated the demon from behind,
but his war club lacked sufficient magical charge to fully
penetrate the demon's magical hide. The Oslander wasn't
going to save her.
The demon slashed a claw down upon the prone elf.
Elowen flipped her sword, on which she had retained her
grasp despite her short are through the air, into a high
block and held it with both hands.
Any other weapon might have shattered, but the liv-
ing blade, despite its strange diminishment, held true.
Elowen felt her arms buckle beneath the impact, but the
claws failed to rake her. That time.
A wall of yellow instantly grew between Elowen and
her attacker. It was Ususi, who once again called upon
the power of her precious wand. The elf hunter used the
seconds the wall bought her to scramble to her feet.
As Elowen rushed around the side of the wall, she
heard a great yell. It was the demon. Gunggari had man-
aged to crack the demon on the back of the head hard
enough to get its attention.
Eschar whirled and advanced upon the retreating Os-
lander. Eschar growled, "If I can't suck the marrow from
the elf's bones, man meat will have to satisfy... until I
catch you all."
The demon breathed in deeply then exhaled. Again,
the very air ignited with hellish fire, sending a snaking
tendril of white-orange flame in Gunggari's direction.
Gunggari dodged aside. Though the flame failed to
fall full upon him, the backwash of heat still brought
blisters to his skin and choked a grunt of pain from his
lips. Worse, he dropped his dizheri.
Eschar paused then, a slightly puzzled expression
looking out of place on the demon's horrendous visage.
He said, "Wait. You numbered one more..."
Screaming in sudden fury, the horned demon whirled
and raced toward the open mouth of the white dome.
226 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 234 ---
Marrec ran along a narrowing corridor of egg-shell
white. Like the inside of a conch shell, the corridor
seemed to whirl ever closer to some still-hidden center.
Marrec became certain that the dome's interior was some-
what larger than the exterior promised. The sounds of
his friends' struggle against Eschar quickly faded behind
him. Then the sounds of his muffled footfall on the hard
surface competed only with the beat of surging blood in
his ears as his heart hammered.
He nearly tripped when Justlance finally, tardily, ma-
terialized in his grip. Good, he needed the light that still
radiated from its tip.
Marrec couldn't decide how many full circuits he'd
made, each one smaller than the last, but he guessed
about nine, when he came to the inmost chamber.
Also dome shaped, rising to a height of at least twenty
feet, the chamber was mostly empty.
Nine pedestals graced the periphery of the circular
room. The pedestals, equidistantly spaced, stood at the
edges of a nine-pointed star inscribed in red across the
floor. Most of the pedestals were empty, though each
contained a hollow concavity, apparently sized to accept
strangely shaped amulets, tools, or other implements
that Marrec didn't want to spend time attempting to
imagine.
Five of the pedestals contained items, though to the
cleric's unpracticed eye it seemed that only one of those
items was actually the object meant to be housed; none
of the other objects fit its particular hollow, shelf, or
hangar so snugly. It was a night black cloak, so dark that
it seemed a void, which was draped across a perfectly
shaped hangar.
The other four items included a dagger made from
a red talon, an orb of hazy green set in a golden ring,
a sword seemingly forged of pale bone, and a chunk of
BRUCE R. CORDELL .227

--- Page 235 ---
white, translucent crystal in which something dark was
caught.
What had the Queen Abiding said? "You'll know it
when you see it" or some such.
He sprinted across the floor to the pedestal holding the
crystal chunk. Hefting it, his fingers were immediately
chilled, and condensation formed, dripping off his hand.
He gazed into the object, studying that which was caught
within. Marrec's eyes couldn't seem to focus on it. First a
smear, then some great winged thing it seemed, then a wrig-
gling worm, then back to a dark imperfection.
The crystal had to be it. He clutched it close. Marrec's
eyes fell across the other items stored in the chamber,
obviously precious bits gathered by Eschar. He suspected
that all were tainted by association with the failed Nar
race. Look what came of them for their congress with de-
mons, he thought. With his single prize, he dashed from
the room.
The cleric made to retrace his route, circling outward,
but leaving the room immediately spit him into the great
cavern. He stood before the open mouth of the dome at the
center of the Sighing Vault a little off balance; Marrec's
body thought it should be racing around in wider circles,
as it had on entering the dome.
His eyes were filled with the form of Eschar, who was
upon him.

CHAPTER 24
Fallon nearly stumbled, his foot catching across
the lintel of the dark room into which he pulled
himself and Ash. He had a sense that something
was following behind him. Too far to see and hear
directly, but the elf could sense something clos-
ing on him. He hadn't heard or smelled anything
specific or seen a betraying light, but a mixture
of subtle clues colluded. The sum of those clues
was inescapable, though he knew most people
would never know they had become quarry until
too late. His sense was accurate enough for him
to discern that that which hunted him was not
the group sent out by the Nentyarch that had
trailed him earlier through that thoroughly
inexplicable extradimensional space. Fallon's
pursuer was something far more implacable.
After all, despite his betrayal of the Ne-
ntyarch, he was a hunter trained by the Circle of

--- Page 237 ---
Leth. His skills were considerable in their own right, even
though their use was no longer sanctioned. Oh well, time
for yet more unsanctioned activity, he decided.
Fallon adjusted the shade on his hooded lantern to a
wider aperture, allowing the finger-thin gleam of light
to widen to a cone of amber radiance. His elven eyes,
sensitive beyond those of men, studied that which was
revealed. share
The side chamber glittered in the increased light.
Some sort of white dust, like particles of salt, coated the
floor, walls, and even the ceiling. Lumps under a powdery
coating were scattered across the floor of the chamber.
Most of the lumps were fist-sized, but a few were larger,
half a foot across bigger. The largest was an elongated
lump almost six feet long and a little over a foot wide,
though it was tapered at each end.
Another exit poked through the far wall of the small
chamber. The dusty covering seemed thicker over there.
Stepping carefully, Fallon approached the largest
lump. Brushing away some of the coating, which shifted
and flowed as if in truth sea salt, Fallon's suspicion
was confirmed: a completely desiccated humanoid body,
mummified and shrunken beneath an ancient cocoon of
material. The elf doubted the whitish powder was salt in
truth, but a remnant of something more insidious. He
didn't have the stomach to investigate the identity of the
smaller lumps.
He whispered to the girl, who still stood just inside
the doorway, "Want to bet something nasty lives through
there?" Fallon gestured toward the small exit in the
chamber where the white coating was thickest. Ash did
not deign to respond.
Walking with practiced ease, Fallon sidled over to the
exit. The beam of his lantern illuminated a short passage
in which lay a snowy layer so thick that drifts completely
covered the floor to a depth of at least six inches. Beyond
the passage, the light revealed a wide expanse. His eyes
230
.
THE PRIESTS

--- Page 238 ---
narrowed, his breath coming in a short gasp when he
registered movement in that far chamber-many, many
somethings.
He breathed easier when, after a moment, it seemed
that he had not disturbed the activity he'd probed with
the lantern beam. A good thing-he guessed that it would
be a lethal journey had he blundered through the drifts
into the chamber. He and Ash would have to go back to
the tunnel they had been initially traversing.
The inklings of a plan tickled him. Perhaps some
misdirection was in order. That which pursued him had
too easy a time of it, stalking a quarry too afraid to turn
aside. Perhaps he would "turn aside" here, he thought.
Fallon estimated he only had about fifteen minutes of
grace, assuming that which tailed him didn't change its
velocity.
The elf opened his pack, looking for the implements he
would need to pull off his subterfuge.
The creature known as Ezekial swept ahead through
the darkness, not hurrying, but like the tide when it
changes, unstoppable. A predator by nature, a killer by
predilection, and an assassin by trade, Ezekial tasted the
essence of the fools that fled before him. One was an elf,
that Ezekial could tell with only a sniff, though the elf
had some skill in concealing its passage. However, with
the elf's scent sighing through his nostrils, very little
could put him off the trail.
The predator's eyes narrowed, as it intermittently
sensed the other member of the duo he tracked. There was
something in that scent that seemed to threaten Ezekial,
in a manner not unlike the eastern sky threatening to
push back the night. He didn't know what to make of that,
and had not Damanda commanded the chase, he might
have decided to pass up that particular quarry.
BRUKE R. CORDELL
231

--- Page 239 ---
But Damanda's command could not be denied. She
was his mistress, his progenitor, his very existence.
The blightlord's cruel domination was the closest thing
Ezekial would ever know to devotion.
A confusion of scents hazed the passage ahead.
A side chamber gave off the main passage he traversed,
like many he had previously passed, though without
a valve or door to conceal its contents. The trail of his
quarry led both ahead and into the chamber.
A crux of indecision; which trail was the most recent?
A few sniffs revealed that the odor of life he followed
like a beacon was stronger to his left. It wafted from the
chamber, enticing him closer. He licked his lips; yes, there
it was-blood. Blood had been spilled, and it was fresh.
Ezekial frowned. He hoped he would not be robbed of the
reward he had promised himself. It wouldn't be the first
time quarry he chased through Under-Tharos fell victim
to something more terrible than himself.
The scent milled indecisively throughout the chamber.
Living creatures had only recently vacated that chamber,
he felt confident, but which way had they gone? His eyes,
functioning perfectly in the absolute darkness, focused
on the chamber's only other exit. A fall of powder, like
snow, spilled from it in shallow drifts.
Footprints tracked through the drifts, leading into the
exit and through the tunnel beyond. The smell was so in-
tense that Ezekial was certain his quarry was just minutes
ahead, maybe seconds. When he heard the slight rustling
from the chamber beyond the exit tunnel, he exulted. The
quarry was trying to hide. Though the sounds were slight,
the vampire's supernatural senses didn't miss much.
So strong was the smell, and so certain was Eze-
kial that the rustling was the furtive sounds of those
he sought, that he failed to note the strangely regular
pattern of the footfalls and the way they did not make
an impression deep enough to carry the weight of a full-
grown humanoid or perhaps even that of a child.
232 THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 240 ---
Ezekial flitted ahead, bursting into the chamber be-
yond, a vicious grin on his inhuman features. He had to
wade through the sea-salt-sized grains that covered the
floor at an increasing depth as he moved forward. The
raspy, white powder then reached his shins.
If his quarry hid in the chamber into which Ezekial
burst, it was burrowed under the massive drifts of white
that covered the floor, shrouded the walls, and dripped
from the ceiling in strange stalactite-like formations.
Only the center of the chamber was clear.
The central clearing, crater-like, held a nearly-black
sphere about one foot in diameter. White lines, the same
color white as the strange substance all around them, ran
like imperfections through the globe. Without visible
mechanism, the globe was slowly spinning on its shallow
bed of pale salt.
Ezekial paused. Was the sound of the revolving sphere
the sound he'd heard?
A moment later he realized not. The sound was that
of the "salt" crystals themselves. Like a ripple sweeping
away from a stone cast into water, the white motes first
closest to the orb, then those further away, and so on,
began to stir. They revealed themselves for what they
really were, unfurling, unfolding, and flexing.
Thousands, millions, maybe, of salt-white, tiny demon-
lings filled the chamber. They were all drawing sudden
animation from the orb, whose eye-like shape peered into
Ezekial's mind.
The vampire had a single moment before the white
mass of demonlings encompassed him, closing him into
a hermetically sealed sarcophagus of sucking evil from
which there was no escape, not even for one such as him.
He might have used that moment to slide his physical
body into shifty vapor. Instead, he surprised himself by
letting rip with a scream of terror-his first and last.
.
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 233

--- Page 241 ---
A cry, quickly silenced, echoed down the passage.
Fallon nearly jumped at the sound's savage ferocity, its
supernatural volume, and its warbling fear. Then he
grinned. Fallon had caught something in his trap. He
rubbed his left palm where he'd cut himself, just a little,
to entice that which hunted him with a smell that he had
hoped would make it less attentive to its surroundings.
The Rotting Man had told Fallon, during their un-
pleasant mental communication, that Damanda would
meet him and Ash in Under-Tharos.
While he'd worked for Anammelech, the blightlord
had related something of Damanda and her pets.
It didn't take too much of a leap to guess that Da-
manda, commanded to collect Fallon, would have her
vampires in tow. In fact, the elf suspected that Damanda
herself was a night stalker, though one of exceptional
skill and mastery. Anammelech had never said.
If one her pets had fallen into the grasp of the hor-
ror the elf glimpsed back in the white room, that still
left Damanda with three of her four favorites, if what
he remembered of Anammelech's idle talk could be
trusted-her inner cadre numbered but four. Three now,
he corrected himself.
When his thoughts tried to return to the abyssal infes-
tation occupying the white room and what his pursuer's
fate might be, he shook his head. Of the abominations
that lay scattered throughout these vaults, he doubted
he had yet stumbled upon the worst. Thinking about any
one of them for too long was unlikely to prove healthy.
He continued forward again, his gait lighter. The elf
retained his grip on the child's hand. She seemed capable
of keeping up with his rapid pace without tiring. As a mat-
ter of fact, she didn't even seem to be making that much
of an effort. Again, he wondered what she represented. He
knew, based on his experience with her and a feeling that
was transmitted merely by touch that, if nothing else, she
represented something good, something uncontaminated
234 ⚫THE PRIESTS

--- Page 242 ---
by poor decisions and something that would not, or could
not, recognize the concept of betrayal.
For Fallon, her touch hinted at restitution and perhaps
redemption.
When a hint of fresher air brushed his face, he
wondered for a moment if his thoughts had conjured a
memory of open air. No, he really did feel a faint breeze,
issuing from yet another side passage.
Fallon bent, sniffed, held a wetted finger in the air
and considered.
"Well, girl," he finally said, grinning, "I may have
found us an exit to the surface."

CHAPTER 25
Eschar collided with Marrec, knocking the cleric
to the side. Marrec nearly lost his grip on the icy
token he'd collected from the nine-fold chamber.
The demon squealed in anger. Marrec sup-
posed he survived the contact because his
sudden exit caught Eschar off guard. The time
it took the cleric to wonder about his survival
was too much. Already, Eschar's hellish eyes
tracked him. The demon's claws moved to make
an eviscerating strike. His hand cold on the to-
ken of control, Marrec felt his options were down
to but one.
The cleric yelled, "Queen Abiding, I release
thee! Come, and serve he who gives you freedom!"
Things happened all at once. Eschar's eyes.
widened as the import of Marrec's words pen-
etrated his consciousness.
Ususi yelled "Marrec, you fool."

--- Page 244 ---
The crystal sphere in the cleric's grasp shattered, send-
ing a spray of ice in all directions.
That which had been caught in the center of the crystal
remained, hovering, a blot of nothing the size of a beetle, a
breath of winter cold expanded, chilling all.
Eschar mouthed a curse whose vileness surpasses
mortal ability to comprehend. Despite his ferocity, he
seemed frightened, then he vanished.
The hovering blot expanded, doubling, tripling, qua-
drupling it size in under a second. It rippled outward
and upward exultantly, growing in height and width
and dimension until it was at least as large as the white
dome over which it hovered. The plunging temperature
proclaimed winter's arrival.
The Queen Abiding was loose.
Marrec, looking into the void of evil above him, said,
"Your tormentor flees. Get him."
Tendrils of darkness instantly grew downward from
the hovering mass, reaching for the area where the
horned demon stood a few seconds earlier. When the ten-
drils reached the vacated space, they continued reaching,
but not in any dimension Marrec was capable of viewing.
The tendrils retracted. Eschar popped back into ex-
istence, tendrils wrapped about his straining torso. The
horned demon screamed in defiance.
The pleasant female voice of the queen spoke from the
darkness. It said, "I told you you'd pay for your effrontery,
Eschar."
Eschar craned his head back and belched forth a
thread of seeking flame, which probed like a fiery lance
into the darkness' underbelly.
The bonds of darkness surrounding Eschar loosened.
Taking advantage of the slackened grip, the demon
struggled mightily and managed to escape the bonds
completely.
Marrec, only a step away from the struggle, uttered,
"No."
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 237

--- Page 245 ---
He stabbed Justlance into the horned demon's abdo-
men. Eschar flinched in pain but tried to make good his
escape, ignoring the cleric's bold attack. The demon began
to sprint toward the edge of the cavern.
Eschar made about ten strides before the darkness
rippled then ballooned in size again. In the blink of an
eye it inflated across the entire roof of the cavern, rose a
storm cloud of night. Then darkness fell. Marrec couldn't
see his own hand in front of his face. All was cold and ut-
terly quiet. When the darkness lifted a heartbeat later,
Eschar was gone.
Elowen watched with unbelieving eyes as Marrec
called forth the sea of hovering darkness. When the void
consumed Eschar, she was mollified, but then she real-
ized that the Queen Abiding must be a far more potent
force even than the horned demon to have eliminated
Eschar so casually. Elowen gripped Dymondheart's
hilt, determined to fight to the last, if that's what was
required.
The cleric was gazing up at the roiling bottom of the
darkness that shrouded the cavern's upper reaches. He
was talking. What was Marrec thinking?
Marrec said, "I have set you loose from your confine-
ment, yet I require your service. By the token which last I
grasped, aid me on my quest. I must face the Rotting Man.
You must help me."
Ususi yelled, "Don't bargain with her!"
The darkness roiled then stilled. Another strand
reached from the lowering belly of the Queen Abiding.
The black tendril probed the ground near where Victori-
cus had melted. Where the black wisp probed, dark liquid
was drawn out of the ground, freezing as it did so. In no
time, their demonic aide was reconstituted.
"Victoricus will lead you to the child you lost," spoke
•
238 ⚫ THE PRIESTS

--- Page 246 ---
the Queen Abiding, as unperturbed as ever. "I sense she
is moving toward the surface."
Elowen studied Victoricus, who tittered. The demon
didn't seem particularly uncomfortable at its destruc-
tion and subsequent restoration.
Marrec pressed, "That is a good start, but listen..."
The cleric licked his lips. Elowen knew then that the
cleric was exceedingly nervous. "I held the token. I asked
for your service. I would like your direct aid against the
Talontyr himself."
The Queen Abiding responded instantly, "Don't press
your hold over me, human. It is tenuous. Oh, so fragile..." A
tendril of darkness dropped and caressed Marrec's face.
"I help you because I have scores to settle. The way I
see it, you are my agent against those who have done me
wrong. Look, I'm free, and Eschar's essence slowly digests
within me. You have been useful."
The queen continued, "Yet I also have a score to settle
with the Rotting Man. The pain he visited upon me when
he briefly held my token, ignorant even of its power, is
something that must be repaid, and here you are, all set
to go against him."
Marrec nodded, said, "You'll help us?"
"One last time may you call on my aid. If you survive
these mazes of ancient betrayal, you may yet come to the
court of the Talontyr. That's when I will come to you,
should you ask."
"After that, our arrangement is ended. If you dare to
ask of me any other service, I shall enjoy supping upon
your soul as, even now, I suck the verve from Eschar's
fiery spirit."
Marrec nodded, somewhat shakily, Elowen thought.
The darkness faded over the space of a few seconds,
replaced by the natural lightlessness of the upper reaches
of the cavern.
Marrec sat down. Elowen moved toward him, but
Gunggari and Ususi were before her.
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 239

--- Page 247 ---
"You've imperiled your soul," said Ususi, "and prob-
ably ours, too, with your foolish stunt. A creature of such
evil doesn't know gratitude or the value of teamwork. It
knows only its hungers and its vengeances."
"I held the token of control," Marrec defended himself.
"What exactly was the token?" demanded Ususi. "I cer-
tainly don't know what its properties were or how much
protection it provides to she who would dare to use it. The
Nar relied on such devices, but no knowledge of their true
nature or the manner of their construction has survived
to the present day."
More weakly, "It seemed to work well enough. Eschar
is defeated. We're alive."
"For the moment," huffed Ususi.
"And we have a guide," said Gunggari, defending his
friend. The Oslander motioned with his head toward the
reconstituted Victoricus.
Elowen wondered why Marrec didn't stand to his own
defense. Perhaps he was uncertain about what he had
done. Certainly she herself had her doubts. All the same,
she laid a restraining hand on Ususi, who seemed about
to continue her tirade. Elowen said, "That's right. Let's go
find Ash and the traitor."
"Aren't you listening at all to what I'm telling you?"
asked Ususi. "We can't trust the queen or any proxy in her
service." She waved a dismissive hand at the ice demon.
Marrec levered himself upright with the shaft of his
spear. He looked at Ususi, to Victoricus, and back. He said,
"All right, I've been foolish. It was a risk to command the
Queen Abiding, but risks must be taken, sometimes, if
goals are to be achieved. If, as you say, the Queen Abiding
cares only for her hungers, then after all the token must
have had some effect over her. If not, wouldn't we all be
but drained husks when she descended upon us?"
"Perhaps," acceded Ususi, "but don't call her again.
Maybe that's all the additional incentive she needs to
return and do exactly what you describe so mockingly."
240 ⚫THE PRIESTS

--- Page 248 ---
Marrec said, "I will not call her unless we're likely to
die anyway. I am acquainted with such choices when it
comes to marshalling potent but dangerous forces." He
rubbed his eyes as he said that last, then continued, "So
what about Victoricus? Should we go on without him?"
Elowen answered. "No. I think we must put our faith
in the efficacy of the token, for as Marrec says, we all yet
live. It'll take too long to retrace Fallon's path back to
where we lost it. If the ice demon can get us closer, then
we should follow it."
Gunggari stated, "If we get close enough, I can pick up
Fallon's trail again quite easily. I'll know if the demon is
leading us too far from where we want to go."
"Just how will you know that?" Ususi challenged the
Oslander.
Gunggari merely smiled. Ususi threw up her hands,
shook her head, and sighed in exasperation. "Fine, fine,
ignore the advice of your sage. You'll be asking my for-
giveness in the seconds before this deal with the queen
goes sour, but I need rest. The edges of my spells are
frayed and uncertain. I must straighten them in my
mind if I can be of any further use. Let us take a mo-
ment before you rush us into whatever trap the queen
has concocted."
Gunggari said, "All of us could use the rest, Marrec."
Elowen thought that several hours' rest sounded heav-
enly. Since they'd descended into the dark, they had faced a
series of terrible threats. Though they'd all survived so far,
their luck was bound to fail if they didn't steal a few mo-
ments of recuperation from the never-ending rush of time.
"Then let's rest," agreed Marrec, not without some
relief in his voice.
They were undisturbed for the length of their rest,
measuring at least six hours. Elowen, not requiring
BRUCE R. CORDELL .241

--- Page 249 ---
sleep, stood watch. When all had regained some measure
of their full strength, Marrec addressed the demon.
"Victoricus. Lead us to our friend Ash, also called the
Child of Light, and who is also an aspect of Lurue."
With nary a titter, the ice demon swiveled and
skated away across the vault field. Ash's would-be res-
cuers followed.
Marrec followed the smoothly moving demon most
closely. At first, he walked alone, as they backtracked
through the Sighing Vault, and tunnels somewhat
familiar. After they turned into a passage completely
unfamiliar, Marrec asked Victoricus to slow down. De-
spite his words to Ususi, he of course couldn't trust the
demon, or the demon's real master, the Queen Abiding.
On the other hand, Ususi hadn't held the token of con-
trol. She hadn't felt the power that had briefly coursed
through his hands when he'd made his initial demand
to the Queen Abiding. Marrec wasn't unfamiliar with
items of potency. In the token's destruction, he'd felt a
call go out, and in responding to that call, the queen had
accepted a binding. She would be good to the letter of her
word. She had no choice, Marrec felt certain. Pretty much
certain.
He could explain his feelings about the token of con-
trol to the wizard, or at least, he could try, but Ususi
was certain of her own learning, her own experience.
After all, wasn't that experience valid? He'd rather not
try to explain to the wizard why he was right, only to
have Victoricus lead them directly into a vat of acid or
some other unpleasantness. Marrec hated eating his own
words, especially if fighting off a demonic double-cross
at the same time.
Victoricus led them past several chambers, all open
to the hallway. A faded chanting spilled from these open-
ings. Marrec couldn't understand the words. He didn't try.
By the timbre of the sound, it was obvious the voices were
not made by any creature with which he was familiar.
242 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 250 ---
It wasn't too far after the chanting that the ice demon
stiffened, looked around, and pointed into a small alcove.
The illumination burning on Justlance's tip revealed a
narrow flight of stairs, fleeing upwards.
Victoricus whispered, "This way."
Gunggari walked to the alcove, bent to one knee, and
examined the floor, the edges of the alcove, and the first
few steps beyond. He grunted, nodding, and said, "Some-
one has recently ascended. More than one person."
Marrec smiled. "Good. I can't wait to see the expression
on Fallon's face when we finally catch him."
Gunggari added, "Actually, more than two have gone
up these stairs-at least three. One set of prints must be
Ash's, they're so small. The others are adults."
"How many?" queried Marrec, worried.
"It's hard to say. Could be as many as four more people,
though some of the prints fade in and out. It is strange."
"Let's hurry, then," Marrec decided.
They filed into the alcove; it was too narrow to go
except one at a time, then on up the stairs, moving with
alacrity. Victoricus, not so proficient on the stairs, fell
behind.

CHAPTER 26
She caught them just as they left the grasp of
Under-Tharos. Some stars were visible through
the overhanging branches of the Rawlinswood,
but their light was not sufficient to illuminate
Damanda and her cohorts as they fell upon Fal-
lon and the child.
The elf hunter struggled in Bonehammer's
grip, before subsiding when Damanda caught
his eye. "Easy, Fallon. You're among friends,
now." She couldn't help but smile when she spoke.
Friendship was something Damanda knew of
only as an intellectual concept.
Slender Absalme caught the child by the hair
and made to lift her free of the earth. The girl
called Ash reached up and touched Absalme's
wrist. A burst of sun-bight light exploded from
where finger touched arm.
Damanda screamed, throwing a hand over

--- Page 252 ---
her face. The light burned her, drove like hammered nails
into her eyes, but an instant later, the terrible radiance
winked out.
When she could see again, blinking away the great
purple blotch, she saw that both Bonehammer and Lex
lay moaning and steaming, just as her own exposed flesh
still smoked.
There was no sign at all of Absalme.
It was clearer to Damanda, then, why the girl was also
called the Child of Light. Damn the Rotting Man for fail-
ing to mention that particular detail. She snarled to her
two remaining lieutenants "Get up, you sluggards."
Luckily, Ash didn't press her advantage. She had
merely reacted to a touch she didn't like and now stood
quietly.
Meanwhile, Fallon also still stood, blinking, though
of course his flesh hadn't reacted quite so explosively to
the light thrown off by the child. Damanda sighed. Fallon
would retain his use, after all, she realized. She glided up
to the elf, her eyes and skin already healing over.
"What were you trying to accomplish, ascending to the
surface, elf?"
Fallon took a breath, then said, "I thought I could get
to the center of Dun Tharos quicker, here on the surface,
where my wood lore would be useful."
Damanda shook her head and said, "You were in-
structed by the Talontyr to lure your pursuers through
the dangers of Under-Tharos."
"I was also entrusted to bring the Child of Light to
him at the center. If I had fallen prey to some wandering
demon below, I couldn't very well do that, could I?"
Damanda's eyes narrowed. Fallon was too impertinent
for an underling. Time to end his independence here and
now. She caught his eye, trying to snare him with her
will. She was shocked when something, some obstruction
in the elf's mind, prevented her. Some influence of the
Child of Light, she knew instinctively.
BRUCE R. CORDELL

--- Page 253 ---
She settled for cuffing the elf. Such was her strength
that Fallon cried out, nearly felled.
Damanda lied, saying, "Listen, Fallon. You're alive
right now because you've proved yourself to our cause.
Don't jeopardize your position with foolish impudence."
Rubbing his jaw, Fallon nodded, though Damanda
thought she could detect a hint of defiance in the set of
the elf's shoulders. She promised herself Fallon's blood,
once he had served his last purpose.
Damanda continued, "We've got to get moving, before
dawn slips over the horizon. Fallon, continue to shepherd
the girl, so that she accompanies us without qualm. She
seems to have taken a liking to you."
The elf hunter took one of Ash's almost limp hands and
did not trigger a burst of destroying light. That settled
it; she'd have to let Fallon live until they got Ash into the
presence of the Rotting Man.
"We'll continue on the surface for a bit, since we're
here; it will be quicker. We'll go to ground in a little place
I know ahead, before the sun rises."
Fallon glanced from her, to Bonehammer, to Lex, and
finally to where Absalme had been destroyed by direct
contact with Ash's light. Damanda didn't doubt the elf
had recognized their nature. Good. In her long experi-
ence, such recognition inspired fear and obedience.
Fallon followed behind the slender woman with purple
hair that Damanda had called Lex, pulling Ash gently
with one hand. Damanda broke the trail ahead of Lex, us-
ing techniques that the elf hunter recognized in his own
woodcraft. The hulking Bonehammer walked behind,
ensuring that Fallon didn't try to run off into the woods,
though he hoped that he had convinced the vampires that
his loyalties lay with them.
Dawn threatened to break within the hour. As each
246 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 254 ---
increment of time passed, he could sense the tension of
the three rising. Of course, he'd known immediately what
they were long before they'd caught him. Unfortunately,
he hadn't been in a position to lay a trap like he was able
to do against the first lone vampiric seeker. He'd decided
that his best chance for survival lay in pretending that
his loyalty to the Rotting Man had never wavered.
Fallon believed he'd pulled off his ruse, though the
blightlord had tried to dominate his will anyway. He had
Ash's earlier expulsion of the Rotting Man's control to
thank for his continued resistance. He squeezed her hand
in thanks, though of course Ash didn't respond.
As he walked along, he began to wonder what he had
gained really. If he truly wished to protect Ash, he would
have to make some sort of break for it and fight these
creatures. The more they drew him into their power and
the closer they ventured into the Rotting Man's territory,
the less likely he could fight his way free with his and
Ash's life intact. Perhaps he should just attack Damanda
right then?
He continued to debate with himself as they walked.
They had already traveled for a few hours through the
forest. He thought it interesting that Damanda made no
effort to hide their passage. It either meant that she no
longer feared being followed by Marrec's group, or that
she actively wished the trail be found, like a lure.
Fallon ventured, "What of the cleric and his friends,
then? Did demons get them after all?"
Starlight revealed a slight shrug from Damanda
ahead. She said, "Perhaps, but when we find the sanctuary
I know of, we'll make preparations, just in case."
Fallon knew that the blightlord wouldn't waste energy
on such 'preparations' unless she knew there was a good
chance that such an energy expenditure during daylight
would have a payoff. That meant that Marrec, Elowen,
and the others-he couldn't recall their names-might
very well be on their trail.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 247

--- Page 255 ---
This meant that he might have allies at his back, allies
who hated him and probably wanted to kill him, to be
sure, but allies all the same. He wondered what he might
do to slow the vampires' progress to give those he hoped
were behind a chance to catch up.
They broke out into a large clearing. The orange light
of advancing dawn revealed a large, mausoleum-like
stone building in the clearing's center. Thick under-
growth partially hid the entrance.
"What is it?" wondered Lex, speaking for the first time.
Her voice sounded like a squealing hinge, irritating and
penetrating.
"It is an old Nar hermitage," said Damanda, sound-
ing pleased. "I found it on a map the Talontyr keeps in
his library. When we followed our missing morsel...er,
friend, up to the surface, I decided we'd get back to the
Close quicker if we took an overland route. I knew this
structure would be around here."
Lex grunted acknowledgement, looking at the light-
ening sky.
They entered the dark building.
None of the vampires commented when Fallon picked
up a length of dead branch before pulling Ash after him
through the entrance.

THE
RIESTS
CHAPTER 27
Marrec smiled when they reached the surface.
They had lost track of time during their sojourn
in Under-Tharos. When the light of day caressed
his face, his spirits lifted a bit. His friends were
likewise affected, all except for Ususi. The wiz-
ard seemed impassive in the sudden daylight
and squinted as if in irritation. Strange woman,
thought Marrec.
Gunggari brought his dizheri to his lips and
played a quick, celebratory tune, which was
difficult with the low, thundering notes the
instrument was mostly able to produce, but the
Oslander managed to sound a cheery refrain.
Elowen clapped the man on the shoulder
when he finished. "What was that tune called?"
she asked.
"Welcome to the Morning. It seemed appro-
priate."

--- Page 257 ---
Marrec said, "Not morning too far along, by the light."
Elowen nodded.
"Gunggari, do you still have the trail?" inquired
Marrec. With the sun above, even through the filtering
branches of the Rawlinswood, they might be able to close
some ground with their quarry.
The tattooed soldier stowed his instrument, crouched.
After a moment, he looked up, said, "It is clearer than
ever. This way."
They traveled then for a time under the boughs of the
forest. Where they had ascended to the surface, the for-
est didn't seem especially corrupt, for all that it overlay
Under-Tharos and was nominally in the control of the
Rotting Man. They had found a portion of the forest
that had escaped direct contamination with evil or rot.
Though the sunlight seemed different there than to the
west or south, harsher, it was sunlight all the same. The
scents of pine and fir were a welcome break from damp
stone. Above, clouds piled high along the skyline as they
rushed toward the dryer east.
It eased Marrec's soul.
Gunggari stopped again. He looked around at an area
of forest that didn't seem too much different than any of
the areas they had just passed, at least to Marrec.
Gunggari said, "There was some sort of meeting here.
I think I understand now. Two were far in the lead, but
four caught up with them, right at this point."
The Oslander searched the ground and nearby trees
more closely. He shook his head, saying, "Something
strange happened. One of the pursuers left quickly. There
is no further sign of that one. The others were involved
in some sort of minor altercation, perhaps just a scuffle.
Afterwards, all continued, but in this direction, toward
the center of the forest again."
Marrec had earlier noted that they had been moving
away from the center. Strange. He asked, "And Ash?"
Gunggari nodded, "Yes, her prints remain clear,
250
THE PRIESTS

--- Page 258 ---
clearer than all the rest, nearly. She was led this way."
He continued to point toward the center of the forest.
"How long, Gunggari?" asked Elowen.
"Sometime before dawn."
"Then we are a few hours behind, at the very most. Let
us make haste."
As they made to move on, Victoricus tittered. The de-
mon said, "I've brought you as far as the Queen Abiding
intended. From here, you go alone."
With its last word uttered, the ice demon cracked, and
shattered into small chunks. The pieces began to melt in
the sunlight.
Marrec said. "It's up to us."
"The demon was useful," noted Gunggari.
Ususi sniffed. Marrec knew the wizard felt otherwise.
He hoped she wasn't later proven right.
They redoubled their pace through the forest, though
Ususi was unable to maintain a speed quicker than a fast
walk for too long, but they made good time. Even Ususi
finally seemed to lose something of the dolor that had
fallen upon the party after their deal with the Queen
Abiding.
Around noon, Marrec judged, Gunggari led them to
the edge of a clearing. The Oslander held up his hand
signaling everyone to stop.
All saw the lone structure. It had an unsavory quality
to it, like something one might find in a cemetery.
"Is it the Talontyr's Close?" whispered Marrec. "I
thought it would be larger."
"No, you'll know the Close when you see it, if the Rotting
Man has truly taken up his seat where the Nentyarch once
ruled," said Elowen. "A great ring of mighty trees surrounds
the Close, if the Rotting Man didn't fell them."
Gunggari signaled again, with some annoyance. He
wanted quiet. Marrec nodded to his friend. Gunggari
must have noticed something. The cleric sidled up and
raised an eyebrow in question.
.
BRUKE R. CORDELL · 251

--- Page 259 ---
The Oslander moved his head close to Marrec's ear and
explained, "The trail goes into that structure. Wait here;
I'll check the borders. If I am unable find an exit track,
we may have caught our quarry."
Marrec nodded. Gunggari went.
The cleric kept his eyes riveted to the structure, wait-
ing. He told Elowen and Ususi about Gunggari's postulate
when they sidled up with questions.
Finally, the tattooed soldier returned from the oppo-
site side of the clearing. He said, "We have them."
"Lurue is kind," muttered Marrec. Then, "Gunny, why
don't you slip up to the entrance first; you're the quietest.
Elowen and I will follow once you're in place. Ususi, stay
back here and provide spell support."
"As if I'd do something different," sniffed Ususi. She
was still mad. That woman could hold a grudge with the
best of them, Marrec mused.
Gunggari flitted forward, running low but quietly,
his dizheri grasped in one hand, his other out for balance.
Marrec stood ready to cast Justlance, but his friend made
it to the wall next to the darkened entrance without stir-
ring notice.
Next he and Elowen moved forward. He couldn't help
it; his chain mail clinked a little as he moved, but he
hoped that the sound wasn't loud enough to penetrate the
building. Elowen was quieter. Both reached the entrance,
spread out on the side wall opposite Gunggari, without
anyone inside reacting to their approach.
All seemed quiet within, save for the subtle hum of
what Marrec supposed to be forest insects.
Marrec turned his head and saw Ususi's silhouette
still back at the edge of the clearing. He saw the wizard's
head nod. He asked, "Everyone ready?"
Elowen drew her blade. Something unexpected hap-
pened then.
When the light of the sun above hit the dulled blade,
the wood began to thrum, producing an earthy tone that
252 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 260 ---
Marrec somehow equated to the sound of growing things.
The veins on the blade, which had shrunk to near invis-
ibility, began to pulse and swell, as if sucking the light
in directly. Tiny flickers of emerald light played up and
down the blade, and the intensity of the sunlight seemed
stronger, more lush, around both elf and blade. The elf's
eyes were wide with astonishment.
Elowen blurted out, "Oh. The Nentyarch's blade... it
wanted the sun. Look, the xylem and phloem..." The elf
ceased to speak as she gazed at her scintillating blade.
Marrec tried to shush the elf, but Elowen realized
her own lapse, clapping one hand over her mouth. She
looked at Marrec, an apology in her eyes, but not without
a matching gladness that had been absent earlier. Marrec
wasn't familiar with the strange druidic terms Elowen
used, but he hoped that their quarry within hadn't heard
her wax so eloquent.
Marrec communicated his hope to Gunggari across the
span of the open entrance with two raised eyebrows. The
Oslander knew what the cleric's questioning stance meant,
so he cupped an ear against the building and listened.
A few moments later he disengaged, his face diffident.
He pointed into the entrance and silently mouthed, "They
know."
Blast. There went the element of surprise. Instead of a
raid, they'd be rushing into an ambush. Better to rethink
the plan. Why not ambush them instead?
Marrec called loudly, "Hello in there. Why don't you
come out? Fallon, we know you're here. Come out, Ash
unharmed, and we may not extract the full measure of
vengeance that you deserve."
He heard a voice speaking, inside, very quietly. It
sounded like a woman's voice, but he couldn't make out
her individual words.
Then Fallon's unmistakable baritone responded, "I
don't think so. We, uhm, I prefer it in here where it's
cooler."
BRUKE R. CORDELL · 253

--- Page 261 ---
Marrec responded, "Who is this 'we' you speak of?
Don't try to hide it; we tracked more than just you and
Ash into this ruin."
"No one you want to meet. Leave here. We're not com-
ing out."
Marrec paused, then looked back toward Ususi, who
still remained at the edge of the clearing. He yelled to her,
"Wizard-why don't you see about flushing our friends
out where we can see them? Be careful, though; we don't
want to hurt Ash."
He saw Ususi rise and step forward. She looked at
him, shrugged, and shook her head no. Marrec wondered
if, based on the kind of magic he'd seen her throw around
in the past, she was unable to whip up a spell quite so dis-
cerning. Then the wizard raised one finger, cocking her
head. Marrec read that gesture as 'But...
Next, she brought two fingers to her face, one to each
eye, then extended her hand to point to the side of the
structure where Marrec and Elowen crouched. Marrec
looked to where she pointed. Solid wall.
Finally, Ususi incanted a spell. When she finished, she
pointed to the wall again, a section of which ghosted into
empty space. Marrec realized she had created a second
entrance. Their element of surprise was back.
"Go," he hissed to Elowen.
He and the elf rushed into the new opening. Gung-
gari, ever the bravest of them, dashed in through the
main entrance.
It was utterly dark, except for the flickering magical
light still clinging to Justlance's tip; the glow around
Dymondheart was too dim to provide light.
Two figures crouched on either side of the main en-
trance. One was nearly a giant, corpse-white, save for
obscene tattoos crawling across his body. He was poised
and ready with a great hammer. The other was a thin
woman in form-fitting black armor, so tight and ar-
ticulated that it looked as if it could be a second skin. An
254 ⚫ THE PRIESTS

--- Page 262 ---
aura of tiny, biting insects surrounded her. Mosquitoes?
Though not as tall as the man, Marrec somehow knew she
was the more potent of the two.
Further back in the shadows stood three more figures.
Ash. And that bastard traitor Fallon, holding Ash's hand
in a death grip. Near him stood a bone-slender woman in
an obsidian cape. Tomes, scrolls, and wands spilled from
her belt. Close cropped hair the color of dying flowers
grew on her head.
Everyone in the chamber turned to look at him, caught
by surprise by his and Elowen's self-made access.
Then Gunggari charged in through the main en-
trance, his dizheri spinning in his hand like a mill
wheel. One edge caught the big man, who hissed, falling
back a pace. Marrec's eyes caught the glint of two overly
developed canines. The big man was a vampire. He prayed
Gunggari could handle one vampire, while he confronted
the woman in articulated armor.
Elowen raced across the intervening ground toward
the purple-haired caster. Good, keep that one occupied,
he silently encouraged the hunter. He and Gunggari had
enough on their plates without having to worry about
spells from the periphery.
The woman's armor caught Justlance's first thrust.
She grinned.
Oh, oh, Marrec thought. Two more canines.
"They're all vampires!" yelled Marrec.
"Great Ones preserve me," murmured Gunggari.
Marrec knew his friend hated night walkers more than
anything else, a hate that bordered on fear.
The woman, still chuckling, said, "That's the least of
your worries. I am Damanda-the right hand of the Rot-
ting Man." Marrec knew what that meant-in addition to
being vampiric, she was also a blightlord. This fight was
going to be a lot tougher than he'd anticipated.
If he could overcome his reluctance, Marrec wondered
if his ability to turn flesh to stone would have any effect
BRUCE R. CORDELL
255

--- Page 263 ---
on the unliving tissue of night walkers. Maybe a true gift
of Lurue, one he had not depleted in the long decline of his
connection with his goddess, might be called.
Bringing his spear up in a guarding position, Marrec
bellowed, "Lurue commands that you give way, unholy
creatures. Turn your faces and be destroyed!" His spear
head, its shape that of a stylized unicorn horn, blazed
with golden light for a moment, briefly shining brighter
than the magical light that Ususi had cast upon it.
Damanda merely narrowed her eyes and hissed. The
large one faltered, vibrating with its desire to resist. Mar-
rec didn't turn his head to see how the one facing Elowen
was responding, but he could feel its resistance, too.
Something wasn't right. The power of the ritual, which
he always imagined as gentle hands on his shoulders, was
anemic. If, in truth, Lurue stood behind him bolstering
him with her strength, then it was as if she only lightly
touched him. Worse, she was backing away, her touch
growing ever lighter, until he couldn't feel it at all.
The resistance peaked; his power broke. None of the
vampires turned away. All smiled the wider. The large,
hammer-wielding nightwalker croaked, "Your god is
weak." Marrec groaned, giving ground. The vampire was
right.
Damanda commanded, "Lex, spell them, will you?"
The purple-haired woman standing near Fallon began
to incant. Elowen closed with the incanter, bringing her
blade around in an arc sure to separate head from body,
but a thaumaturgic field shimmered into visibility, de-
flecting the blade. Lex finished her spell, and a wave of
violet light expanded from her, washing over everyone
in the room.
Marrec felt his joints begin to lock up but shook off the
effect. He saw that Gunggari also resisted the magical
hold. Not so Elowen-the elf hunter stood rooted in place,
struggling, but unable to command her body into motion.
Gunggari made to dash to Elowen's side, but his
256 ⚫ THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 264 ---
corpse-white opponent was too near, swinging his great
hammer in deadly parabolas, promising death to Gung-
gari if the Oslander's attention wavered.
Marrec was pressed by the blightlord Damanda. She
moved in, the noise of her insect aura growing mad-
deningly loud. Recovering more quickly from his failed
attempt to turn back the vampires than Damanda ex-
pected, he thrust forward with Justlance.
The tip bit deep, momentarily dimming the light in
the room, then it was nearly torn from Marrec's hand
as Damanda twisted back. She swiped at him with one
hand-no, it was some sort of clawed or bladed gauntlet
composed of darkness itself. The blade caught him along
the side, scoring his flesh, but not mortally. Both combat-
ants staggered back a pace. Marrec observed Damanda's
wound begin to knit in a way that his own did not.
The blightlord grinned, her teeth again prominent.
She pointed at him. The insect mass swarming around
her bulged, sending a filament of biting mosquitoes his
way. Marrec expected that the insects, like their master,
were vampiric.
The mosquitoes would suck him dry in seconds if he
didn't do something....
He called upon his secret heritage. He found it lurking
just behind his eyes like a hound eager to be let out. Mar-
rec complied, focusing his attention on the swarm as if a
single entity. For a moment, he felt a connection between
himself and the tiny points of hunger, but in the very
instant the connection was made, it was transformed and
snuffed out. A hail of tiny stones fell as one from the air,
shattering into so much dust. Damanda's insect aura was
stripped from her with Marrec's glance. A pain lanced
Marrec's eyes like before. A weakness suffused him; he
knew that his ability to call on his deplorable heritage
was depleted for now.
Despite the pain and the blood trickling from the cor-
ners of his eyes, Marrec smiled at Damanda.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 257
•

--- Page 265 ---
Not so the blightlord. She yelled, "What's this? A me-
dusa posing as a human?"
A shadow occluded the doorway-Ususi. She appeared
mid-spell and with a flourish, released a cascade of bril-
liant electrical arcs, stabbing full into Damanda and
Gunggari's foe. Both staggered and flailed, as the flesh
smoked and boiled under the intense magical assault.
Damanda spoke, tiny sparks flashing across the gap of
her opened mouth, "Lex! Stop gawking; kill the one you've
immobilized."
Marrec tried to get to Lex, the vampire mage standing
next to Elowen, but Damanda, still smoking, was on him
again. Gunggari grunted with a similar exertion, beating
back his foe. They were both pinned.
In a fluid single motion, Lex extruded spindly white
hands, claw tipped, from the folds of her black cloak,
and grabbed Elowen as if to embrace her. Lex opened her
mouth wide, creating a gap larger than any mere human
could accomplish, and brought her head toward Elowen's
unprotected neck.
The vampire shuddered, pausing. "Huh," grunted Lex,
releasing her hold on Elowen. She bent her head to look
down at her chest. From it protruded the broken end of a
wooden branch, darkly slick with pooling blood.
Fallon stood behind Lex. It was he who had thrust the
branch through the vampire's chest.
Marrec blinked-Fallon saved Elowen's life.
Already shriveling and smoking, Lex turned and
slashed Fallon with her razor sharp claws. In a spray of
blood, both went down, Lex crumbling and Fallon grasp-
ing at his neck.
Marrec's gaze, Ususi's unexpected assault, Fallon's
betrayal, and Lex's destruction was enough for the blight-
lord. She pulled a rolled parchment from her belt with
one hand while reaching out to tap her last remaining fol-
lower with the other. She began uttering the arcane words
inscribed upon the parchment in short, clipped breaths.
258. THE PRIESTS

--- Page 266 ---
Marrec threw Justlance. The spear screamed through
the empty air that a moment earlier contained its intend-
ed target. Damanda was gone, likely back to the court of
the Rotting Man.
On the ground where he'd fallen, Fallon struggled,
gasping. Marrec and Gunggari rushed across the
chamber, Marree to Ash's side, Gunggari to kneel next
to Fallon. Ususi stepped tentatively into the chamber,
looking around suspiciously. Elowen, still standing
stiffly, groaned and tried to move her arms. She man-
aged to do so, if somewhat clumsily. The compulsion was
apparently lifting.
"Are you ok, girl?" Marrec asked Ash, inspecting her
for bruise, blemish, or other sign of poor treatment. Ash
was unmarked. He hugged her close.
Gunggari inspected Fallon's bleeding neck wound. He
said, "Marrec, his wounds are beyond simple tending, and
the Nentyarch's satchel is empty of healing balms."
Marrec knew that Gunggari, in speaking of his
satchel, was actually asking if Marrec retained any
healing grace. Marrec met his friend's eyes, shaking his
head. The cleric remembered seeing named vials in the
satchel, one of which contained his own name, but none
had contained Fallon's name. Disengaging from Ash, he
bent, too, at Fallon's side.
Fallon looked up at Marrec, whispered, "I should never
have taken the girl. I am sorry..." He stopped, coughing
blood.
The unicorn warrior said, "It was a brave thing you
did, just now. In the end, you chose right."
Fallon, breathing shallowly, smiled then said, "I know."
He breathed his last, a smile frozen on his unmoving
lips.
Marrec gently closed the elf's staring eyes. "May Lurue
grant you redemption."

THE RIESTS
CHAPTER 28
Damanda and Bonehammer fell from a height of
over ten feet. Damanda corrected, landing on
her feet with perfect grace, though Boneham-
mer stumbled and fell heavily onto a pile of
crumbled brick.
She had panicked. She had used her emer-
gency escape scroll, as unreliable as it was, when
things turned sour. Luck was with them. Despite
the scroll having been scribed by Lex years ear-
lier, and Damanda's only passing facility with
the arts of wizardry, both she and Bonehammer
made the uncertain transit and in full possession
of their limbs.
Shafts of afternoon light bored into the
chamber from two high punctures in the ceiling.
Luckily, neither of them had appeared beneath
those rough apertures. Damanda had picked
the bastion of retreat the very moment Lex had

--- Page 268 ---
penned the scroll, of course. A fortified but empty build-
ing in the middle of the Dun Tharos ruins still above
ground, it had seemed unlikely to fall into disrepair after
having stood for so many centuries. It was near the Close
but not in it, in case it was from the Rotting Man she had
to use her escape. Despite the odds, in the intervening
time the structure had moldered and fallen into further
disrepair. That would teach her for choosing an above-
ground retreat. Of course, she couldn't repeat her mistake
even if she wished. Lex had been destroyed by that prince
of betrayal, Fallon.
Damanda roundly cursed the elf, envying the Rot-
ting Man his way with words and ancient languages but
making do with her own obscene vernacular. At least Lex
had slashed the little bastard as she fell. Damanda knew
lethal blows. She doubted she'd see Fallon again.
"What now, Damanda?" inquired Bonehammer, al-
ready back on his feet. With the light of day so close, the
wounds given by that odd dark man with the strange war
club were not mending as quickly as they should.
Damanda considered her minion's question. She said,
"The Talontyr once told me that the cleric and his band
would bring the Child to him of their own accord. If that
is true, we merely need to arrange an ambush of such.
magnitude that nothing can survive it; well, we want the
girl to survive, of course."
"Perhaps we should refrain from setting an ambush, if
they're going to come to the Rotting Man anyway."
"I'd rather the Talontyr receive the girl from the
hands of his trusted lieutenant."
Bonehammer nodded; he was nothing if not a yes man
to Damanda's will.
While the sun remained above, they were trapped
there in her emergency redoubt. On the one hand the
building stood within sight of the Close itself. Once dark-
ness fell, she'd raise an army. In a few hours, she'd gather
hundreds of blighted volodnis, twig-blights, and other
BRUCE R. CORDELL. 261

--- Page 269 ---
rot spawned creatures. She knew all the passages, all
the ways that the Close could be accessed, both above and
below ground. If the cleric pressed ahead with his fool's
errand, they'd be caught and flayed, there was no doubt
in her mind.
First, a bit of rest. Activity during the day, even spared
direct light, was taxing. Yes, a bit of a lie-down was called
for, she decided. Soon, in just a few hours, the sun would
dip below the horizon. Then her full powers would return.
Her quarry was as good as in her grasp.
Ash bent, touching the limp form of Fallon on the
forehead. Where she touched, a glow lingered before suf-
fusing the body. It seemed then to Marrec that Fallon's
motionless form sighed.
Ash said, "Redemption he has."
Marrec turned quickly to the crouching girl. "Ash. Can
you hear me?"
The girl rose, the look of compassion fading from her
face, animation fleeing her body. In a moment, she looked
as she always did-unresponsive and uncaring.
Marrec was grateful for the small miracle that moved
Fallon to save Elowen from the vampire's bite. He mur-
mured thanks to Lurue. He just wished the betraying
hunter had decided to return to the light before he'd
kidnapped the girl. Had it been so, perhaps all might
now be different.
"Now what?" wondered Elowen.
"We continue to head toward the center of Dun Tharos
and confront the Rotting Man. With Ash in our keeping,
we may have some protection," replied Marrec.
"Going overland will take days-yet I do not wish to
return to Under-Tharos."
"True," said Marrec. He turned to the Oslander, "What
do you think, Gunny?"
262 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 270 ---
"Either route has its difficulties. Above ground we'll
likely run afoul of the Rotting Man's forces-such was the
original reason we decided to approach from below-but
the subsurface route seems far more indirect and danger-
ous than we hoped. The path is not clear."
"It is not," agreed Marrec, sighing.
Gunggari continued, "If the blightlord had retreated
physically rather than magically, I might have tracked
her back to the center." The Oslander shrugged.
Ususi held up one hand. "Hold on... that gives me an
idea."
The imaskari grasped the Keystone that she still wore
around her neck. She brought it to her eye, then began
scanning the chamber as if gazing through a looking
glass.
Marrec furrowed his brows. "Surely the Mucklestones
do not reach so far?"
Ususi said, "They do not, but listen. The Keystone is a
tool designed for use with the Mucklestones, true, yet it
is also sensitive to all magic associated with portals and
transport. Perhaps the magic used by Damanda to escape
left a seam in space, as such spells often do, though they
always fade quickly. I might be able to locate the seam us-
ing the Keystone... and there it is!" the wizard crowed.
"What good is that to us?" wondered Marrec.
When they appeared, Marrec and the others did not
fall ten feet like Damanda and Bonehammer. Despite
utilizing a raw, poorly executed, and fading seam in real-
ity, Ususi had the Keystone. With its power, she grasped
the unraveling threads of Damanda's escape, wove a new
portal, and transported the group into an echoing ware-
house with nary a bump.
Marrec blinked-slanting shafts of daylight beto-
kened approaching twilight, but it was still brighter
BRUCE R. CORDELL
263

--- Page 271 ---
than where they had just stood. The cleric slowly turned,
scanning the area for Damanda and her hulking hench-
man. As he looked, he kept one of Ash's hands firmly in
his left hand. In his right hand was Justlance.
Loose brick rubble covered the floor, piled in untidy
heaps in some places. Dust covered all. Gaps in one wall
revealed a ruined cityscape, tumble-down and covered
in forest growth. Ususi had thought that the endpoint of
Damanda's escape lay near the center of Rawlinswood.
The mage was correct. They must be somewhere within
Dun Tharos, in one of thousands individual ruins that
made up what remained of the ancient Nar city.
Where was Damanda?
If she was in truth cursed with vampirism, she
wouldn't enjoy standing there, indirectly illuminated by
fading daylight. Perhaps farther back, where the ceiling
allowed through less light?
Marrec pointed to the rear of the building, lost in
shadow, where a slender stone door stood closed. Gunggari
caught his gesture and nodded. Marrec released Ash's
hand. He looked down at the girl and said, "Stay here."
Ash studied the middle distance. With his free hand he
unstrapped his shield from his back.
The cleric and the Oslander approached the door. Elow-
en was not far behind, her blade still shimmering with its
exposure to the sun it loved. Ususi hung back.
Without losing time to doubt, Marrec heaved open
the stone door. It fell backward, unsecured to the lintel,
generating a terrific rolling boom as it struck the ground.
Beyond was a tiny chamber without exits, no more than
fifteen feet on a side. The light from Justlance's tip re-
vealed two forms lying upon the ground, side by side,
arms crossed across chests, eyes closed.
One reclining figure was Damanda, the other Bone-
hammer.
Before he could get his sinews to respond or cough out
a warning, the eyes of both the sleepers shuttered open.
264 THE PRIESTS
..

--- Page 272 ---
Damanda jerked upright like the arm of a catapult,
without the intervening need to lever herself up as a liv-
ing creature might. Her arms shot forward as her form
moved to vertical, catching Marrec in the chest. That su-
pernatural shove bowled him back through the narrow
entry and out into the brick-strewn warehouse. A brick
cut him above the eye and another across his forearm.
Marrec gained his feet, cursing his slowness. He heard
Gunggari yell, then a clash of arms. Elowen called out
the Nentyarch's name, as she so often did when fighting.
Ususi stood to the side of the doorway, not committing to
entering, but chanting and waving in the midst of casting
a spell.
The cleric charged back into the room. Boneham-
mer, lurking by the door, caught him on the side with
his great weapon-Marrec barely caught the blow on
his shield, though his arm nearly went numb with the
effort. He was forced to step back a pace. Had the vam-
pires fought that hard a few hours ago, Marrec doubted
he and his friends would have survived. Something was
different. As his shield glinted in a stray beam of sun-
light, Marrec realized what it could be-the vampires
were trapped-the only place to run was either outside
the building into direct sunlight or there into the main
warehouse where a stray beam like the one that'd just
fallen across his shield would have more serious conse-
quences on vampiric flesh.
He yelled, "Gunny, herd them out this way-into the
sunlight."
Ususi unleashed a spray of magical bolts that traced
wildly arcing trajectories through the air. Many of the
bolts found their mark in Damanda's flesh. The vampire
was undeterred in her fight with Gunggari and Elowen,
but she spared a smoldering glance for the wizard in the
doorway. Ususi screamed, threw her hands before her
eyes, and fell back.
Marrec hoped that glance wouldn't prove to be trouble
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 265

--- Page 273 ---
later. He knew about the domineering gaze of vampires.
Elowen growled, "I'll keep this one pinned-help
Marrec with that other one." Gunggari danced back, his
warclub landing a parting shot to Damanda's head, which
was absorbed with a grunt of pain.
Dymondheart seemed to grab Damanda's attention
more than the dizheri. She didn't merely absorb Elowen's
swift swings-she deflected, ducked, and spun to avoid
taking a cut.
Gunggari was upon Bonehammer, smashing with an
unrestrained fury that momentarily startled the vam-
pire. Marrec saw his chance, ducked under his foe's guard,
and came up on the other side.
"Now!" yelled Marrec, hoping to coordinate his activity
with Gunggari's.
He and the Oslander dashed themselves directly into
Bonehammer. Marrec threw his arms about his foe, who
promptly turned his head and sank his fangs directly
into Marrec's neck.
A fire blossomed there, and a weakness. The weak-
ness felt something like his loss of contact with Lurue,
but more immediate and far, far more lethal.
Though his strength seemed to be flowing from him,
with Gunggari's help he forced the vampire back, step by
step, into the larger, ruined chamber.
The angle of the sunlight was becoming extreme. A few
minutes more, maybe less, and the sun would be down, but
such questions no longer mattered for Bonehammer.
Marrec and Gunggari forced the struggling, biting
vampire directly into a reddening shaft of pure sun-
light.
"Damanda!" screamed Bonehammer, as he released his
bite on Marrec's neck.
He began to thrash, so violently and fast that neither
man could maintain his hold, but it was no longer neces-
sary to hold him. Bonehammer was speared in place by
the shaft of sunlight.
266 THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 274 ---
Their foe's whipping limbs moved so quickly that
Marrec could barely discern them. Smoke coiled off the
vampire's skin, and a reddish radiance peeked from
Bonehammer's open mouth, his nostrils, from behind his
eyes, and even from his fingernails. The next instant all
burned through. The fire that had been ignited inside
reached the surface. A flash of all-consuming heat and
red light left nothing behind but ash and disintegrating
fragments of skull and spine. Even that smoked away a
second later.
Marrec sagged. He worried that the vampire's bite
would reveal itself as a debilitating, life-draining wound,
but he didn't fall. There was still Damanda.
"Let's bring the other one out," he whispered to Gung-
gari, though the Oslander was already half way back to
the fight where Elowen kept the blightlord at bay.
Marrec spared a glance for Ash. The girl remained
standing where they had appeared, looking completely
out of place in the darkening ruin. The last shafts of light
penetrating the building dimmed still further and were
finally extinguished. The sun had set.
Marrec stumbled back to the door, bypassing Ususi
along the way. She stood shaking her head back and
forth, as if trying to throw off a hallucination. Trouble.
He could tell. Damanda...
Back in the sealed antechamber, Elowen had the
blightlord backed into a corner. The vampire feared
that blade; its sap was suffused with pure sunlight, and
Marrec perceived it was also made of wood. He couldn't
imagine a better weapon to use against a vampire.
"Cleave her, Elowen-she can't heal Dymondheart's
blows. You can slay her outright."
Between gritted teeth, parrying Damanda's blows,
Elowen said, "What do you think I'm trying to do?"
Gunggari was already in the mix, applying his dizheri
with abandon. Marrec heaved himself forward, still
feeling weakness flooding every limb. He brought up
BRUCE R. CORDELL 267

--- Page 275 ---
Justlance. Perhaps he could pin the elusive blightlord in
place...
Damanda screamed as she received a cut from Dy-
mondheart across the stomach. The flesh crackled and
smoked as if the light of the sun itself had touched her.
"We've got her," said Gunggari.
Damanda shrieked and spun, put her head down, and
ran directly into the wall behind her. The ancient ma-
sonry, already unstable, gave way before the vampire's
supernatural strength. Hardly checking her speed, Da-
manda burst through a hole of her own making, bricks,
mortar, and larger stone blocks falling around her.
Damanda had made her own exit.
Through the breach in the wall, all could see the ru-
ined street of Dun Tharos. Elowen and Gunggari raced
each other to see who would be first after the vampire;
Elowen won. Marrec brought up the rear, noticeably
slower than his two friends.
The forest-infested ruin of Dun Tharos was silent in
the gathering night. There was no sign of the blightlord.
Marrec screamed in frustration. Then, thinking Da-
manda might be playing them for idiots, he rushed back
into the smaller antechamber, then on into the ware-
house. Ash remained, as did Ususi, who had apparently
recovered from her shock.
She asked Marrec, "What happened?"
The cleric continued forward until he stood again at
Ash's side. Then he said, "The blightlord escaped, again,
but we destroyed her last servant." He pointed with his
spear where the final fragments of Bonehammer lay.
"Are you ok? I saw her try to lock gazes with you."
"I'm fine," answered the wizard. "Just took me a few
moments to clear my head."
Elowen and Gunggari returned.
Elowen said, "We are near to the center of Dun Tha-
ros. I can nearly see the great trees that surround the
Nentyarch's old seat. Great trees, filled with life and en-
268 THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 276 ---
ergy, each one so tall and grand that you wondered how
such a thing could exist..." The elf seemed overcome for
a moment with memory.
Gunggari said, "If we are so near, we should press for-
ward, before the escaping blightlord can warn her master,
and he can mount an answering defense."
"The time has come, eh?" Marrec questioned his friend,
strangely reluctant now that it had come to it.
His weakness persisted. His thoughts were muddied,
and even Justlance seemed heavy in his hand. He didn't
want to come up against what would likely be his greatest
test in such a condition, but there was no choice. He would
endeavor to ignore his state. It was the final push.
The cleric took Ash's hand again, intending to ask her
if she was ready, though he knew she wouldn't respond.
Ash surprised him by squeezing back, as if truly feel-
ing the pressure of his grip. She looked at him, truly met
his eye for just one amazing moment. In those eyes, Mar-
rec found rest and the promise of renewed strength. He
gasped, but already Ash's grip had slackened to its usual
flaccid strength.
Once more, Ash had shown forth her secret, inner
power. The strength promised in her eyes grew and blos-
somed in the cleric's flesh. Marrec felt hale and whole of
body and mind. Moreover, for a fleeting moment, it felt
as if his nascent connection with Lurue herself might
return. The momentary bonding weakened immediately
then winked out, but it left a lingering feeling of hope,
and his renewed vigor didn't hurt.
"Yes, the time has come to face the Rotting Man, even
here in his place of power," Marrec told Gunggari, but
loudly enough to address everyone. "With Ash at our side,
I believe we have a chance."
"One moment, though," cautioned Gunggari. He looked
over to Ususi. "What of her? She met the vampire's gaze.
She could be under the blightlord's influence."
"Don't be an idiot," barked Ususi.
BRUCE R. CORDELL .269

--- Page 277 ---
"It's not idiotic to enumerate our weaknesses prior to
battle."
Ususi responded, "No simple glance by a blightlord
can suborn my mind; I am stronger willed than that.
She merely caught me off guard-had I been any less
strong, yes, she might have had me. What you perceived
as weakness was in fact my fighting off her insidious in-
structions. I'm happy to note that I was successful."
Gunggari studied the mage, no expression crossing his
face. Marrec knew the Oslander well enough to interpret
the look. Gunggari didn't trust Ususi's words.
Marrec shrugged. Before Lurue's absence, he had
access to spells that might have cleansed any taint poten-
tially remaining from the vampire's gaze. He said aloud,
"She seems fine."
That earned him a quick smile from Ususi. Of course,
he mentally vowed to keep an eye on the mage, too.
"It is time to beard the Rotting Man in his lair," said
Marrec. "Everyone ready?"

THE
RIESTS
CHAPTER 29
Great plazas and wrecked temples devoted to de-
monic powers lay half-buried in the boggy forest
that covered all. Stone, cracked and broken into
numberless pebbles, littered the expanse, hint-
ing at tumbled statuary, building facades, and
other structures. Only ruinous heaps remained
of what was once a grand avenue, overgrown
with forest plants. There was an arch that
still stood, but it looked upon an empty cinder,
flooded with foul water. Stagnant pools floated
a detritus of wreckage and age-old destruction,
but despite the growth, the crumbled grandeur,
and encroaching marsh, the outlines of a once-
great city were clear, visible despite the lowering
twilight.
Elowen took the lead, but Marrec paced
at her side. She had once walked these very
streets, before the Rotting Man took possession

--- Page 279 ---
of the Nentyarch's guardian fortress at the center of
Dun-Tharos. Her knowledge allowed them to find a dry
path over the half-drowned streets.
As they trudged along, alert to every shadow, Elowen
volunteered, "The Nentyarchs ruled from the forest castle
at the center for nearly six hundred years, preserving the
Rawlinswood from the encroachment of human kingdoms
that sometimes sought to loot the Nar conjuries."
Marrec commented, his voice quiet, "A strange place to
choose as a druid capitol."
"Perhaps, but the Nentyarchs believed that the ruins
of the old Nar capital remind us of humanity's ability to
wreak harm on nature. On the other hand, the forest that
encompasses the city offers an example of what might be
accomplished with patience, strength, and belief in the
sanctity of nature."
"Hmm." Marrec didn't know if the elf hunter offered
wisdom or an excuse. Before he could formulate his
thoughts into something more politic, his eye caught
movement high above the trees.
"Say, what's that?" Marrec pointed to a darkness
growing in the sky. Light was fading too quickly to be
the natural fall of night. It almost looked like...
"A thunderhead," said Elowen. "The cloud is forming
unnaturally quickly, and unless I'm turned around, it is
above the Close."
Lightning flashed within the boiling thunderhead,
as it continued to grow and expand outward in all di-
rections. The smell of rain, mixed with something foul,
gusted across them.
Gunggari said, "The Rotting Man knows we are
coming."
Marrec couldn't gainsay his friend's conclusion.
They passed down a ruined street, dotted with pines
and potholes, between gaping buildings missing doors,
windows, and in many cases ceilings and even walls.
Then they turned down a wide lane. Before them, not
272 THE PRIESTS
•

--- Page 280 ---
more than five hundred yards by Marrec's estimate, was
the Close.
It was as if the largest trees ever to grow naturally in
the world were all gathered together in one place, trunk
to trunk, in a great ring. From their perspective, and
with the failing light, Marrec couldn't know the diameter
of that ring, but he guessed that the great trees encom-
passed a circle at least half a mile in diameter.
The great trees were bare of green leaves or needles,
seemingly dead. Worse than dead, they were gray and
stony, petrified. But they swayed in the rising wind
as the thunderhead above began to make its presence
known. Or was their movement controlled by some
deeper malevolence?
"That bastard," said Elowen, looking upon the petri-
fied trees, a tear on her cheek.
With a flash of lightning and a crashing clap of
thunder, a driving rain emerged from the belly of the
black cloud. Marrec and his friends were instantly
drenched in the water, which smelled stagnant.
The weakening light revealed that the great fortress
of dead trees had a glow all its own-a faint greenish
phosphorescence-not the green of living things, no, but
instead the essence of gangrene itself-greenish black,
pustulant, and pulsing. Thus, even with the arrival of
night and through the mist produced by the driving rain,
Marree was able to see the forces that began to stream
from the Close.
He had thought the great petrified trees were fused
together, but there must have been enough space to navi-
gate between them. Like cheese squeezed from a colander,
lines of figures squirmed from between the trunks. The
figures, once free of the Close, massed and moved down
the lane toward Marrec and the others.
The cleric noticed that the ruined buildings on ei-
ther side, too, were disgorging ungainly figures. There
were hundreds of figures closing upon them at a dead
BRUCE R. CORDELL 273

--- Page 281 ---
run, with dozens more appearing each second.
Marrec took a pace forward. Gunggari stepped up to
Marree's left, but a pace behind. Elowen remained to his
right, also back a pace. Ususi remained directly behind
Marrec, but with space enough between to shelter Ash.
In that way, they encircled the girl.
As they rushing forms grew closer, Elowen said,
"Volodnis. They're all rot-touched, like those we fought
in Lethyr."
It was as Elowen said. A tide of blighted volodnis
threatened to flow over them, and the rain continued to
fall, cold and uncaring.
The blighted volodnis were worked up. They hissed,
shouted, and stamped their feet. They broke upon the
defenders like a tide, but Marrec held steady. Justlance's
tip became a silver flame in his hand like a thunderbolt,
a veritable rod of death to every volodni who opposed him.
Marrec slew them as fast as they approached. To his right,
he saw Elowen make a similar impact with Dymondheart,
save when she slew, the volodnis' rotting bodies took flame
with purifying fire. To his left, Gunggari laid about him,
dispatching foes with his sap-spattered dizheri. Behind
him, he could hear the continual chant of Ususi, bolts of
magical fire laying volodnis low-sometimes one, some-
times several at once.
They advanced. Through the flashing lightning
and implacable rain, the silhouette of the Close loomed
larger.
They fought, they cursed, and they slew, and the tide
continued to part, and a trail of the dead grew behind.
Larger shadows begin to stir on the outskirts of the fight,
which in a flashing dazzle of lightning were revealed as
reinforcements for the enemy-twigblights. Marrec real-
ized that the Rotting Man must know the secret of their
animation even without the aid of Anammelech.
The cleric shouted above the thunder, "We can't fight
both volodnis and twigblights and hope to win."
274 THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 282 ---
Ever economical in wielding his disheri, the Oslander
took a moment to shrug, which became the initial move of
a dramatic swing that laid two volodnis low.
Each volodni they slew allowed the menacing twigb-
lights to move closer through the crush. They didn't have
to get too close, though-the ones Marrec could make out
were fifteen, maybe twenty feet high. Already some were
leaning out over the volodnis, seeking to lash Marrec
with claws of splintered wood.
Time for the bargainer to make good, Marrec decided.
He screamed out, "Queen Abiding, answer to your final
agreement. Aid me."
The sky changed instantly, as if she had been waiting
for the call, just out of sight. Where before was driving
rain, lightning from the thundercloud, and the sick
glow of the petrified forest, there was nothing but black.
Tendrils of darkness reached down from that immensity,
stabbing into the boggy ground like twisting roots, but
more often spearing a blighted volodni or screeching
twigblight. Darkness was upon them.
The queen had come.
The void continued to descend. The Rotting Man's
blighted forces cowered and screamed. They sought to
escape, but the periphery was already void, so they ran
back and forth. Vainly they crawled and clambered,
packed into the narrowing space like swarming flies,
wailing, calling upon the Talontyr for aid. Their cries
were for naught. Some attempted to flee directly into one
of the walls of advancing nothingness. In that shadow
they found their end.
The lowering void contracted. Sight was taken from
Marrec. All sound ceased. Even the sound of the cleric's
own heartbeat was denied him. Marrec wondered if
perhaps he should have heeded Ususi's warning about
dealing with demons.
Hearing returned and sight, too. The wide lane was en-
tirely clear of blighted volodnis and twigblights. Neither
BRUCE R. CORDELL 275
.

--- Page 283 ---
the blood, the sap, nor the bodies of those already slain,
nor the surging mass who a minute earlier had been in-
tent of overwhelming Marrec and his friends remained.
Of the void, only a blot of darkness persisted, almost
lost in the rain-streaked night sky, visible only as an ab-
sence when lightning streaked.
The queen spoke. "It is finished. If we meet ever again,
you shall discover the fate that has befallen your foes."
Then the void, too, was gone.
The crashing thunder echoed hollowly down the lane.
"Forward, then," urged Marrec. His voice was hoarse,
rough from the fear that had sleeted through him before
the darkness lifted.
No one replied. Perhaps all were feeling an emotion sim-
ilar to Marrec's. The cleric's relief was tempered with the
knowledge that they had yet even to break the perimeter
of the Close, and already he had used up the one resource
he had thought to unleash on the Rotting Man himself.
It would have to be his petrifying gaze, then, should
he get so far, he decided. What an awful surprise it was
to him that he would at last come to rely on the evil as-
pect of himself that he had so long sought to forget and
suppress.
Their footsteps clattered on the wet stone of the lane.
The tops of the petrified trees towered over their heads
as they approached, the branch tips lost in the lightning-
rent clouds. Marrec sighted a space between two of the
great trunks wide enough to pass two abreast and moved
toward the cavity.
They were in. They walked a narrowing path of mud,
mold, and mulch of long-dead leaves between two great
boles, each as wide and tall as a cliff face. The rain
couldn't reach into the tight space, and the sound of the
thunder above was muffled. The light on Marrec's spear
tip proved the only illumination.
"This is the perfect place for an ambush," noted
Gunggari.
276 ⚫ THE PRIESTS

--- Page 284 ---
Marrec had entertained the same thought, yet they
continued ahead unmolested. After about twenty paces,
the aperture between the trees reached its narrowest,
forcing Marrec to walk sideways. He shuffled forward
quickly, certain that an attack was imminent, but no.
The passage between the trees began to widen again.
They were through. They stepped into the Court of the
Rotting Man.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 277

THE RIESTS
CHAPTER 30
The Court of the Rotting Man was a great plain
encircled by petrified cliffs that towered into the
sky. In truth, from within, the ring of colossal
petrified trees resembled a steep caldera or crater
heralding some ancient catastrophe.
When the court was the Nentyarch's Seat,
the space within the ring of then-living trees
had been green and filled with garden paths
that wound through groves of flowers and fields
of fruit trees, watered by carefully maintained
brooks that passed around daisy fields and under
quaint stone bridges.
With the coming of the Rotting Man, life
had moldered and gone to rot. The paths were
washed-out mud tracks, smelly and home to
worms and stinging flies, the fruit trees bore
only blots of poisonous putrescence, the brooks
were dry, and the flowers long since dead. Great

--- Page 286 ---
holes pockmarked the Court, throwing up great mounds
of fresh, muddy earth in places, lending a cemetery feel
to the entire space.
Carved back into the inner surfaces of the petrified
trees were scores of doors, openings, and dark windows
that hinted at chambers, halls, rooms, passages, and
alcoves that could lie behind them. Catwalka connected
passages from tree to tree. A veritable army could dwell
therein: blighted volodnis, twigblights, blightlords, pris-
oners, slaves, and whatever other dreadful creatures the
Rotting Man kept under his sway.
The center of the Court was where all eyes were drawn.
In the Nentyarch's day there had been a simple wooden
structure built from specially grown and reverently har-
vested hardwoods. What had changed since the coming of
the Talontyr? A great mist, seeping up from the rot and
mound mud hills, obscured the center of the plain.
At least the overhanging and interwoven branches of
the ring of petrified trees high above sheltered most of the
court from the rain, though flashes of light, rolling booms,
and the occasional fall of water continued to gain entry.
Elowen pointed the tip of Dymondheart at the cen-
tral mass of fog. Only by moving forward, into the mist
itself, could the cloaking fog be pierced and the center be
revealed. They approached it, careful to keep away from
mud that seemed too deep, or cavities in the ground from
which the smell of rot issued too strongly. Unfortunately,
they could not entirely avoid the stench of decay, but by
luck, skill, or some other agency, nothing challenged
them as they approached to the very edge of the mist.
Marrec plunged into the clammy whiteness, his
companions arrayed about him, and Ash tucked safely
among them. The stench of rot grew more intense within
the mist, though perhaps the loss of sight merely inten-
sified the other senses. They trudged forward, Marrec
hoping that he was ready for anything. Again, nothing
challenged their approach through the fog.
BRUKE R. CORDELL 279

--- Page 287 ---
As they walked, Gunggari opened the satchel given
him by the Nentyarch. He pulled forth four vials and
distributed three of them to his friends, one apiece.
Marrec looked at his, "What's this?" though he guessed
what it might be.
"The last four vials within the Nentyarch's satchel. I
perceive that we are about to come face to face with our
nemesis."
"What do these do?" wondered Ususi.
Gunggari shrugged, said, "I do not know-these last
four were written with a label containing each of our
names only. I inquired of the Nentyarch what these
vials represented before our abrupt departure from Ye-
shelmaar. He indicated that each elixir was different, but
each would provide a strength best suited to the needs
of its named imbiber. I presume this vial, for instance,"
Gunggari indicated the one he had retained for himself,
"will grant me strength of arm." He shrugged again, "But
I do not know."
Marrec palmed the vial in his left hand, retaining
his grip upon Justlance in his right. His comrades made.
similar arrangements.
When at last the fog began to thin, the center was
finally revealed.
The Nentyarch's home, as described to Marrec by
Elowen, was gone, with no evidence of it having ever
been there. In its place was a lone ash tree-an ash tree
of towering size, a hundred or more feet high, though still
below the height of the overhanging petrified branches,
crowned with an oval mass of sickly green leaves. The
leaves hinted that the tree lived, but even so, it was af-
flicted. The bole was twisted, blackened, and terrible.
The tree's leaves seeped a sick fluid, and at its base was
a massive swollen cyst, partially burst, though the poor
illumination failed to reveal what lay within the cavity.
Immediately before the cyst was a throne of hardened
but putrid mud. A figure sat the throne. The Rotting Man.
280 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 288 ---
From where Marrec and the others exited the mist,
they stood not more than forty or fifty feet from the
throne and that which sat upon it, but Marrec couldn't
help but shudder when he saw the Rotting Man. To his
right he heard Elowen cry out, Ususi curse, and even
Gunggari take a deep breath. Ash apparently had no
reaction, though Marrec didn't take his eyes from the
putrid seat.
The Talontyr was the size of a man, but a man wasted
with rot, disease, and madness, from whose pores con-
stantly seeped droplets of blood. The Rotting Man's body
was a battleground for hundreds, maybe thousands, of
virulent diseases, all of which strove against each other
and the flesh which hosted them.
The Rotting Man could not perish from such ravages.
Such was the gift of Talona, the Lady of Poison, the Mother
of All Plagues, and other names more gruesome. Rot was
the Talontyr's strength.
Before the Rotting Man's throne was an altar of rough-
cut stone upon which sat a crystal vase. The vase held a
slender stem to which a single bone-white petal clung.
To the Talontyr's right stood Damanda, glowering. She
had reacquired her swarm aura.
Surrounding the Talontyr and Damanda were vari-
ous creatures, all disfigured with lesions, pustules, and
other outward signs of sickness, though of course in the
Court of the Rotting Man, these creatures obviously
drew strength from their condition. Unfortunately, the
Rotting Man's forces created a buffer too wide for Mar-
rec's special gaze to touch directly upon the author of all
their misfortune. Among the creatures arrayed around
the throne, Marrec recognized a green-tinged unicorn, a
satyr whose eyes were gone but for oozing sores, a score
of nixies or perhaps pixies-each the color of night, a
dryad whose ongoing wide-mouthed scream of pain was
too raw to be heard any longer, some diseased wolves and
bears, plus a few monstrous insects the size of men....
BRUCE R. CORDELL .281

--- Page 289 ---
"Ash!"
Marrec glanced back. The child he had so long shep-
herded was gazing with apparent interest at the large ash
tree. Recognizing it. Naming it. Ash and ash...
Before Marrec could comment or question the poten-
tial enormity of Ash's pronouncement, movement drew
his eye back to the front.
A bone-slender hand slothfully extended from the rot-
ting garments that clung to the Talontyr. The pointing
finger selected Marrec as its target.
A voice, hoarse and phlegmy yet resonant, issued forth.
The Rotting Man said, "The game has been amusing, but
it is over. I will take the child. Now."
A beam of virulent power pulsed forth from the Rot-
ting Man's entire body, washing over Marrec and his
friends before any could do much more than blink and
draw a breath in surprise.
Marrec fumbled with his spear as his vision cleared,
expecting pain, wounds, or worse, but he was fine. Look-
ing around, he saw that his friends were unharmed, too.
Of them all, only Ash seemed unsurprised. In fact, she
had somewhere acquired a golden glow, a glow of health,
vitality, and promise.
"So," said the Rotting Man, executing a look so sour
that Marrec's stomach threatened to turn.
Struggling for breath, the cleric finally managed to
find his voice. He said, "We've come too far to fail now."
The unicorn warrior didn't know exactly why the
Rotting Man's assault had drained away so ineffectu-
ally, though he guessed that already Ash's nature was
beginning to assert itself. He needed to seize the moment,
salvage some time for Ash to discover the missing por-
tion of herself. That, after all, was the reason they had
come so far.
Marree continued, his voice gaining in strength and
authority, "We've brought Ash, the Child of Light here,
against all the obstacles you've set. We know the girl is
282 . THE PRIESTS

--- Page 290 ---
but part of the Aspect promised by the Green Powers,
among which my goddess Lurue numbers, the Aspect that
was sent to end your reign here in Dun-Tharos."
The cleric knew his speech was too short, but he didn't
quite know where to go from there. Ash was not taking
any special action or initiative, unlike what he had imag-
ined, except, of course, her mere presence may have been
the only reason he and her other companions yet drew
breath following the Rotting Man's initial assault.
The Rotting Man hacked out laughter. Chuckling wet
gasps of amusement, he finally said, "You have brought
her to me, haven't you? All my effort to bring her here,
yet where all my servants have failed, you succeed.
Marvelous!"
"Not true... you were trying to kill Ash. Kill her so
the Aspect could never take full shape."
"No, I'm afraid not, young simpleton."
"You fought us hard enough just outside the ring of
your fortress," replied Marrec, confused.
"It is true I expended many of my servitors, many more
than I thought I would, truth be told. I did not foresee
that you would make common cause with a demon. If I
had not thrown my forces against you, you would have
begun to wonder why I offered no resistance here at the
heart of my strength. You would have wondered if you
were walking into a trap, which indeed you were."
The Rotting Man went on, "You have something that
I require. It may be that it retains sentience enough to
protect itself and you against my direct touch. However,
experience reveals that my servitors are under no such
restriction."
The figure on the throne croaked something to Dam-
anda. In turn, Damanda screamed, "Bring the child to the
Talontyr; kill her guardians."
Marrec brought up his left hand, his thumb already
flipping the cork from the vial he held. As the creatures
surrounding the Nentyarch surged forward, Marrec
BRUCE R. CORDELL 283
•

--- Page 291 ---
gulped down the contents of his vial. Of his friends, only
Gunggari did the same; Elowen raised her living blade
and gave voice to a cry of challenge; Ususi began to incant
a spell. Ash did nothing.
The rot-eyed satyr charged Marrec, its head down and
the ram-like horns positioned to smash him. The elixir
Marrec had just drunk, fruity and pleasant, seemed to
open his sinuses and expand his lungs. The potion was
nothing less than liquid revelation, laying bare all that
was shrouded, even Marrec's own clogged conscious. Facts
about himself broke free from his subconscious and begin
to bob toward his surface awareness-but he didn't have
time to take note. More than anything else, the elixir
opened a door, however briefly, that had been shut in
Marrec's mind-it made a connection where association
had fallen away over the last few years-it granted him a
channel to Lurue's grace.
The blighted satyr collided with Marrec, sending
Justlance clattering from his hand, yet the cleric smiled.
Not because he retained his feet despite the charge, not
because his spear returned to his grip almost instantly-
Marrec smiled because unfeigned hope woke within him
as he contemplated the array of abilities returned him.
Gunggari smashed the carapace of a five-foot-high
beetle, then engaged the green-hued unicorn in a
desperate battle-the Oslander attempted to beat the
unicorn senseless before the blighted creature succeed-
ed in eviscerating Gunggari with its blackened horn.
The pack of blighted nixies swarmed Elowen. The elf
wove a defense by slashing Dymondheart too quickly for
even a nixie to penetrate. She cursed when one still man-
aged that feat and promptly bit Elowen with too-large
teeth stained midnight black.
Ususi's chant grew louder, in Marrec's experience, that
indicated that a spell of power would soon be unleashed.
Damanda then said, "Ususi-I command you to slay these
who you call your friends."
284 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 292 ---
Ususi choked, ceased incanting, and instead began
to slowly reach for the yellow wand at her belt. Her arm
shook, and her hand moved only slowly, as if she fought her
own hand's movement every inch of the way, yet progress
was made.
The cleric began a chant of his own-with his new con-
nection to Lurue, he felt he could dispel the evil influence
that allowed Damanda to instruct Ususi. The damned
satyr charged him yet again, spoiling what would have
been his first god-given spell in days.
Marree screamed in a fury quite unlike his normal
manner, then was forced to defend himself physically
with Justlance. Instead of incanting a spell, he yelled
between spear thrusts, "Gunny, stop Ususi!"
The Oslander was pressed just then by a growling wolf
that'd lost most of its skin to a cancerous scab that made
its flesh particularly resistant to Gunggari's warclub.
Damanda laughed as Ususi's hand closed about the
Wand of Citrine Power. The wizard drew the wand from
its slender sheath, her face contorted as she fought the
compulsion.
A shaft of brilliance like the sun's, full and true,
touched down then, piercing the mist, the overhanging
petrified branches, the storm, and even the night. It fell
around Elowen, who was holding her blade above her head,
its shining surface reflecting and sustaining the sunlight.
Elowen brought the blade quickly down from its position
above her head, pointing it directly at Damanda, who still
stood beside the Talontyr on his earthen throne.
A ray of citrine probed at Elowen from Ususi's shak-
ing wand. The wavering ray failed to find its target, but
Ususi took aim anew, shaking her head as if denying her
actions.
The greater shaft of sunlight surrounding Elowen
changed its focus, sliding smoothly away from the elf
and toward the target identified by her pointing blade.
Elowen yelled, triumphant "Meet the day unbound!"
BRUCE R. CORDELL 285
.

--- Page 293 ---
Damanda screeched, backpedaling. The Rotting Man
raised an eyebrow in apparent interest, nothing more.
The shaft of light slid across the intervening blighted
creatures without harm, moving more swiftly as it ap-
proached Damanda.
The vampire began to run, but the shaft of light caught
her, just as Ususi's second wand-aimed ray struck the elf
hunter in the back. In a moment, Elowen was encased in
a slab of amber-like crystal, unmoving.
The following beam of sunlight was undimmed and
flashed full upon the fleeing blightlord. Damanda's
scream was so horrible that even the Rotting Man's forces
paused a moment to determine the vampire's fate.
When the shaft winked out a moment later it was
established once again what happens when a vampire is
subject to sunlight.
It dies.
Marrec, having recently witnessed another vampire's
fiery death in similar fashion, recovered a moment quick-
er than the hollow-socketed satyr. His erstwhile foe sank
to the earth, stupidly clutching a newly created third
cavity in its skull, courtesy of the cleric's spear.
The blighted unicorn turned away from the crystal-
encased Elowen and charged Gunggari from the side.
The Oslander avoided being disemboweled by the horn
but received a nasty wound across his side.
Marrec saw that Ususi was back in control of her fac-
ulties. He'd have to trust her to release Elowen from the
confinement she'd created. He lunged sidewise, catching
the blighted unicorn with the untainted unicorn tip of
Justlance. The contact instigated an instant and dramatic
response from the blighted creature-its eyes rolled wildly;
it reared, neighing, then it collapsed.
The scabrous wolf leaped again at Gunggari, growling
and slavering. Again the Oslander beat back the wolf.
Marrec didn't want to shift too far over to help the
Oslander-he needed to plug up the middle, between
286 THE PRIESTS
.

--- Page 294 ---
the Oslander and the slab of crystal holding Elowen-
otherwise nothing would protect little Ash who still
sheltered at his back.
Ususi finally found her voice, cried out, "I can release
the elf," then began casting anew.
Gunggari's dizheri finally found purchase-the wolf
yelped, rolled, then ran off into the mist. Another crea-
ture immediately moved to take its place-a twigblight.
Worse, additional blighted creatures threatened to
break around the other side of Gunggari, Marrec, and
Elowen's line that protected Ash. Ususi remained in the
midst of a spell. Marrec quickly counted all that still stood
between himself and the Rotting Man. He estimated only
about ten or so enemies. With his connection to Lurue
back, he wondered if he couldn't catch them all-or at least
most-in a burst of holy power tuned to banish evil.
Ususi finished her last spell. With a tinkling of shat-
tering glass, Elowen shed her crystal containment. The
elf shook her head, looking around to see what she had
missed.
"Hold, my creatures," spoke the Rotting Man.
The blighted creatures paused in their onslaught,
uncertain of their master's command. Marrec and Gung-
gari paused, too, wondering what deal the Talontyr might
be willing to offer. The Talontyr was getting nervous,
guessed Marrec.
"I tire of this game. I begin to think you'll pierce my
defenses, and what? You'll attack me directly, Talona's
Chosen?" The Rotting Man laughed.
Marrec considered throwing Justlance right then, or
perhaps moving just a bit closer in order to bring his gaze
to bear, but the Rotting Man continued speaking. "While
it might be edifying for you to begin such a contest, it
is beneath me. It's more fitting, really, that you meet
your end at the hands of that which you've come so far
to meet."
The Rotting Man half turned on his seat, still choosing
BRUCE R. CORDELL 287
•

--- Page 295 ---
to sit even in the presence of his enemies. He waved his
hand toward the great cyst bulging from the base of the
tree behind his throne. He said, "Yes, Talona informed me
far ahead of time of the Green Powers' gift to the world.
I moved to intercept it. I grew the Thieving Ash to snare
the divine energies of the gift as it was born into the
world. Those energies are contained therein, infused with
my own special touch, Talona's blessing, and the goad of
continual pain."
Marree whispered, "Thieving Ash?" He looked around
at the girl behind him. The child's eyes focused then on
the cyst, as if she expected something wonderful to
emerge-or something terrible.
The Talontyr, nearly giggling in sudden glee, con-
tinued, "Yes, the child there with you is the portion of
the Green Powers' gift that slipped through my fingers.
Thank you for delivering it to me. Finally! The entire gift
is now mine."
"Behold, then," continued the Talontyr, "what has
become of the Aspect of Light. Behold Talona's Step-
Daughter!"
The fleshy flaps obscuring the partially burst cavity
heaved and ripped. A fantastically large bubble of blood
swelled darkly from the fissure, and immediately burst,
releasing a wave of liquid in every direction. Shrieking,
the blighted creatures surrounding the throne scattered
before the scarlet flood, though the Rotting Man laughed
as the stinking bile poured over him.
Something still fought to free itself from the
cyst-something too large for Marrec to immediately
comprehend. It heaved itself free of the cavity, showing
first a vast expanse of festering flesh twenty or thirty
feet on a side, like the side of a hill come to life. The
heaving, pulsing body was supported by four wide legs,
elephantine in their simplicity and shape but larger, yet
the struggling monstrosity, when it finally extricated it-
self from its woody chrysalis, was headless. It was a vast
288 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 296 ---
mass of gross flesh supported by four massive legs with
no front or rear, only body. Except... something protruded
from the creature.
A slender horn, convoluted and fluted, but straight and
spear-sharp at the end, jutted from the infected flesh. The
horn was over fifteen feet in length if it was an inch, yet
Marrec recognized its likeness from the first. The horn
was like a unicorn's.
"Abomination!" The words tore themselves from Mar-
rec's throat. The wrongness of the creature, the warped
nature of its existence, the plight of the Gift-it was all
too much for the cleric to bear. He ran forward, past the
throne on which the Rotting Man sat. A look of intense
concentration suffused the Talontyr's face, but Marrec
barely noted it as he moved closer to the vast bulk.
Gunggari ran forward with Marrec. The Oslander
was more nimble than Marrec remembered, jumping
and leaping ahead with new-found vigor. Perhaps it was
the influence of the Nentyarch's final vial? Gunggari
moved so quickly that he passed the cleric, running up
so he was nearly beneath the Daughter. Utilizing his
forward charge, Gunggari swung his dizheri around,
two-handed, delivering a mighty blow upon the crea-
ture's lower flank. The Daughter's flesh rippled, and
from somewhere, though no orifice was visible, a basso
scream erupted.
The Daughter's single horn slashed through the air
with uncanny speed, nearly decapitating Gunggari-it
would have, were it not for the Oslander's newfound
quickness.
Marrec began incanting a spell, a spell he'd been un-
able to cast for months, a defensive spell. As soon as he felt
its protective embrace enfold him like an old friend long
missed, Marrec continued forward. He would try first his
newfound connection with Lurue-he would try to turn
the creature from its present course, perhaps break it
from the control of the Rotting Man.
BRUCE R. CORDELL 289

--- Page 297 ---
Bringing his spear up, Marrec bellowed, "Lurue com-
mands that you give way, abomination. Turn your face
and be destroyed."
His spear head, its shape that of a stylized unicorn
horn, blazed with golden light. Unlike when he had tried
this same ability against the vampires, his power did not
break. He radiated a surge of holy power, which washed
upon and over the Daughter.
The creature's entire bulk shook, and a deep cry issued
again from some unseen maw, but the creature would not
be turned from its directive. The horn slashed forward,
elongating as it moved, spearing at Marrec with a life-
ending thrust. If not for the cleric's just-cast defensive
spell, he'd have been skewered. Still, the shock of the
thrust sent him stumbling back.
By that time Elowen charged the Daughter, too.
She came up to the creature several feet from where
Gunggari danced, trying to keep from being trampled
beneath the creature's stamping feet. Fancy sword-work
was impossible-she faced a creature too large for such
niceties-it was too mindless to be distracted by feints
and too massive for a blade to deflect a horn-thrust or a
trampling foot.
Elowen ran up and shoved Dymondheart directly into
the side of the creature, all the way to the hilt. Then she
began to saw the blade back and forth, trying to lever the
wound into something much larger. A spray of vile mat-
ter, fecal by its stench, began to spray from the widening
wound, but the elf hunter had no time to finish her task.
The massive horn, supernatural in its ability to elongate
and shorten at need, found a new mark. The Daughter's
horn swiveled and struck, slamming lengthwise into
Elowen's body. The elf was sent bodily flying through the
air, Dymondheart spiraling away the opposite direction.
When Elowen rolled to a stop, she failed to rise.
Ususi finally entered the fight, this time on the side of
her friends. A ray of yellow stabbed forth from her wand,
290 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 298 ---
but she targeted not the monster but its progenitor. The
ray fell full upon the Talontyr as he sat his throne. A flash
of amber and a crack that competed with the thunder still
rumbling above followed. The Rotting Man was unfazed.
The power washed away from him with no effect, other
than to catch his attention.
As Marrec cast Justlance deep into the side of the
Daughter-causing the creature to buck and squirm, but
only in apparent annoyance-the Rotting Man spared a
splinter of his attention for Ususi.
He said, "You sought my attention-see what you make
of it."
He gestured, and a wave of muck and rot gathered and
flowed from around his throne, building, cresting and
falling upon the wavering Ususi.
Where the wave passed, the imaskari stood unharmed,
surprised to still retain her life. Ash's influence still pro-
tected them from the Rotting Man's direct power. Indeed,
Ususi had moved to stand ahead of the child, even in her
fear thinking to protect Ash. It was the child who offered
their only protection there in the Court of the Rotting
Man.
Marrec glanced back at Elowen. The elf had not stirred
from where the Daughter's horn had thrown her. Marrec
realized she was out of the fight. He didn't dwell on how
hurt she might be. If they were unable stop the Daughter,
they would all find themselves in a similar or worse state
soon enough.
Time again to bring his gaze to bear. The Daughter
had no eyes. Could he even affect that corruption of divine
energy given life? He opened wide his eyes and reached
again for the feeling in the back of his mind, the core of
ferocity, the ember of his heritage. He called upon the
gaze of the medusa.
Invisible lines of influence plunged from Marrec's eyes,
instantly wracking his head with pain. Where his gaze
touched upon the Daughter's side, flesh bubbled-bubbled,
BRUCE R. CORDELL 291

--- Page 299 ---
The cleric felt for the tattooed warrior's pulse-faint,
growing fainter, but still beating. Marrec called joyfully
on his renewed link to Lurue and poured healing into
his friend, but Gunggari's flesh was grievously wounded.
The Oslander opened his eyes but remained prone. He had
managed to stabilize Gunggari, stop the bleeding. That
would have to be enough.
The Daughter completely ignored Marrec, even though
the cleric fairly kneeled at the creature's feet. Furious at
the fusillade of spells with which Ususi continued to
burn it, the corrupted aspect charged the mage. Ususi
cried out, seeing her death approach. She shot a look of
apology Marrec's way, touched the Keystone hanging at
her breast, and was pulled backward, out of the Rotting
Man's court by the power of the amulet. She was gone.
The Daughter, deprived of its intended target, stumbled
to a stop, its immense but dreadfully quick legs causing
the ground to quake with each and every footfall. Its bulk
hid from view both the Rotting Man and... Ash.
Marrec stood and began running in a single action.
The creature was between him and his charge. If it killed
her, then all their effort was for nothing.
Justlance was in his hand with merely a thought, but
what hope did he really believe he had? The creature had
proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was nigh on
unstoppable. What force could hope to breach its bulk
and reach its heart?
What physical force... but wait-the beast was born of
a gift of the Green Powers. It was a corrupted aspect, but
an aspect all the same, and somehow, Lurue was tied up
in all of it. Was slaying the creature the answer? Though
foul, at heart it must be good. Something that seeks to
do good, though it commits evil, can be redeemed, or so
Marree hoped.
BRUCE R. CORDELL
293

--- Page 300 ---
then ceased all motion, as flesh became stone. He couldn't
encompass the creature in a single look-he had to paint
the Daughter with his gaze, moving left to right, right
to left, and in the wake of his passing glance, flesh gave
over to stone.
The Daughter reared up. A massive slab of hard-
ened stone sloughed away to reveal terrible pink flesh
within. The slab of stone, once part of the Daughter's
side, smashed into rubble, forcing Gunggari to skip
away, though a few chunks caught the Oslander on the
side, drawing blood. Marrec didn't care. His power was
overcoming that of the Daughter. His vision began to fill
with red, blood pooling in his sockets from the strain, but
still he pumped his force of will through the connection
he'd made with the Daughter, through the thrumming
invisible line of his sight.
Gunggari's wail of agony was as water on the fire of his
effort. The force of his gaze winked out immediately. The
Daughter, rearing, had caught Gunggari. The Oslander
was down. Down, too, came those hideously heavy feet,
stamping. Gunggari rolled, but his pain hindered him,
and he couldn't roll far enough. The Daughter's foot
smashed down upon the tattooed soldier, breaking bones
and bursting flesh. The tattooed soldier joined the elf
hunter in stillness.
If Gunggari by some miracle retained grasp on life,
his bleeding body would soon betray that effort without
immediate tending. Marrec didn't waste time thinking
about it-he simply ran full out for his friend's side.
Where he presumed that Elowen yet survived her con-
tact with the Daughter, he knew his friend would not. He
might already be dead.
A geyser of fiery energy poured down upon the flank
of the Daughter, distracting it long enough for Marrec
to reach Gunggari's side. Ususi was still in the fight and
unleashing her most potent spells against the rampaging
horror.
292 . THE PRIESTS

--- Page 301 ---
The knowledge that was flushed from hiding by the
Nentyarch's elixir finally completed its work. Revela-
tion illuminated Marrec, then, like the sun that lifts
up from behind a mountain, revealing the plain that
was previously dark. Marrec saw a parallel between
Ash and himself, and the Daughter and his monstrous
gaze. Moreover, he saw an equivalence between any
creature that hopes to do good, but through inaction,
inattention, poor judgment, or even self-interest, does
evil. Does that action, then, condemn such a one to a life
of evil thereafter? Does it mean that that one does not
deserve a second chance?
Well, no, of course not.
Life is but a brief flicker, and as the saying goes, "What
will it matter in one hundred years?" is all too true for
most creatures. Life is a short-lived gift. If that gift is
not explored in all its dimensions, it is like spurning the
gift, setting it aside on a knickknack shelf where other
things of little interest accumulate. How else can life be
experienced but through decisions? How else can good
be judged from evil, if mistakes are not made? That was
the secret that revealed itself to Marrec: To err is to live,
and to live is to err, but one can only pick oneself up after
each mistake, wiser for the experience, and go on. What
else is there?
One had to forgive oneself.
The Daughter's horn nearly removed his head from his
torso as he skirted its bulk, bringing him more fully to
the present. Taking the knife-sharp blow along the haft
of his spear, Marrec ran on, rounding the flank of the
Daughter. There was the Rotting Man, still sitting upon
his throne, concentrating upon the corrupted aspect, pos-
sibly controlling its actions, or at least preventing it from
lapsing into unrestrained destruction.
294 THE PRIESTS
'

--- Page 302 ---
There was Ash, defenseless and alone in the Court,
looking up into the blank expanse of the Daughter's
flesh, as if searching for something. Despite having no
eyes or any other organs for sensing its environment, the
corrupted aspect paused, seeming to study the slip of a
girl on the ground before it.
The Rotting Man commanded, "Take what is yours,
Cystborn. Take the capstone of your power and your sen-
tience. Become what you should have been these last six
years. My scourge, Talona's Step-Daughter."
The Daughter moved forward, as if to engulf the de-
fenseless child, but slowly, tentatively, as if the Rotting
Man wished to relish his final victory.
Marrec, his head still spinning with his own personal
revelation, knew that his own revelation applied, too, to
Ash.
"I forgive you, Ash," yelled Marrec. "That's right. We
all forgive you for allowing the Rotting Man to steal
away your purpose, your form, and your power, but you
have to forgive yourself."
Ash's gaze slowly swiveled upon Marrec and focused.
She was listening.
"Let yourself off the hook-put your mistake behind
you and learn from it. Take back what is yours. You didn't
mean for things to come to this."
Ash's eyes narrowed, and her tiny head began a slow
nod, as if in grudging understanding.
"Enough of this. Consume her!" thundered the Rotting
Man.
The Daughter fell upon Ash, absorbing her entirely
into its shambling husk.
The Rotting Man laughed. The cleric despaired, crying
out his frustration.
The Daughter lay splayed across the ground where it
had leaped upon the child.
Then a change came over it. The Daughter's body be-
gan to throw off mass in great rotting layers, one after
BRUCE R. CORDELL ⚫ 295

--- Page 303 ---
another, like an onion. Every layer broadcast images into
all the living minds nearby-the layers were like records
of the sordid malice the Talontyr had committed against
the world. The first few were only insults and aggrava-
tions. Then came violence and death, and rot followed
after. It was Talona's influence, psychically manifest as
each section of the Daughter fell away. The next layers
revealed the Rotting Man gathering to his side minions
versed in spells and foul sorceries. Marrec saw piles of
skulls left behind where the Talontyr's forces triumphed;
he saw living trees burned with torches, the tree-dryads
locked within, screaming; he saw crimes without
number, and creatures rotting from the inside; he saw
sacrifices made to Talona in all their gruesome detail.
Marrec saw the war of the Green Powers against Talona,
and the secret plan the Rotting Man and his goddess
drew up to subvert those plans and redirect those efforts
to decay. Every layer that fell away from the Daughter
revealed fragments of the past to Marrec, as if he were
remembering something he'd always known.
Then the molting layers revealed more recent occur-
rences. Marrec saw blightlords releasing poisonous spells,
rots of terrible efficacy, and magical diseases spreading
across the Rawlinswood and across the forest of Lethyr. He
saw the cruel new sorceries devised by the Rotting Man.
Seeing, the cleric understood what the Rotting Man intend-
ed should the Daughter ever achieve complete integration;
he saw the massacres, the deaths, the plains strewn with
slain armies left to decay and disintegrate in the noon-day
sun. He saw the Rotting Man's hope for final triumph.
Little of the Daughter was left now. The core of rot
remaining scrambled like a live thing, trying to escape.
Marrec stabbed it with Justlance. Screaming, the blot
skittered away but Marrec stabbed it gain. It lay quiv-
ering, and Ususi, stepping out of the surrounding mist
where she had hidden, burned the place where it lay with
magical flame.
296 ⚫ THE PRIESTS

--- Page 304 ---
The layers were shed and the core was gone, but some-
thing remained behind, hiding behind the core. It was
washed clean. It was whole, complete, and shining. It was a
great unicorn, white and gold, with eyes too bright to look
into, or maybe it was a woman, whose features reminded
Marrec instantly of little Ash. It was the woman Ash
would have grown up to be. Rather, it was the Aspect the
Green Powers had intended to send all along. Araluen.
Araluen fixed Marrec with a look from her blazing
eyes. She said, "I forgive myself for succumbing to the
Rotting Man's trap, as you have forgiven yourself for your
accident of birth. Redeemed in our own eyes, we are both
of us fit to serve Lurue." The unicorn touched Marrec
lightly on the forehead with its crystal horn. Knowledge
was imparted to the cleric, and he smiled.
With curses so potent that minor creatures of decay
were produced from each utterance, the Rotting Man
stood up from his throne.
The battle between growth and decay, years delayed,
was joined.

THE
RIESTS
CHAPTER 31
The form of the Talontyr shuddered. His skin
rippled, split, and something far larger emerged
from the husk-a nightmare of slime and liq-
uefying limbs, melting and reforming. At the
same time, the Aspect incanted a series of divine
syllables. Her body grew in stature equal to that
of the Talontyr rebirthed, and a sword of celestial
fire ignited in her hand. Then she was upon the
Rotting Man in a fury of righteous might.
Groaning, the rotting husk gave ground,
but not quickly enough. The celestial blade
cleaved the slime-ridden form, splitting it into
two heaving masses. The section farther from
Araluen continued to retreat, its gesticulating
arms spraying gore as they jerked through an
intricate series of spell-casting motions. Mean-
while, the split-off portion of the Rotting Man
heaved and pulsed-each section retained a life

--- Page 306 ---
all its own. It threw itself at the Aspect, its side splitting
to reveal a great toothed maw.
Araluen cried out as the attacking portion of the Rot-
ting Man bit at her sword arm, its mouth crunching and
slobbering. Light, not blood, spilled from the Aspect's
flesh, and it burned the beast, forcing the creature to
relinquish its hold, but the monstrosity's incanting twin
finished its spell.
A ghastly greenish-black cloud blossomed above, but
beneath the overhanging branches of the Close. Crashing
claps of thunder boomed in its depths, the sound so loud
that the Aspect winced and backed away, shaking her
head as if to clear it of ringing tones.
The creature leaped again, this time taking a bite
from Araluen's side. Again, light spilled forth from the
wounded avatar, and again the rotting creature's flesh
boiled in the light, and it retreated. The Aspect hacked at
it with her sword for good measure, using the flat of her
divinely fashioned blade. Its impact caused the creature
to shudder and squeal, but it did not further subdivide.
The gesticulating portion of the Rotting Man pointed
straight above at the boiling green cloud. In answer, six
jagged bolts of lightning ripped from the clouds belly,
each one finding its target: the Aspect. The blast was
too searing for sight to survive, and the wind that fol-
lowed knocked every creature flat that stood within a
hundred feet. The shock wave shredded the mist that
still clung around the periphery of the space, whipping
it away in steaming ribbons, revealing the entire space
of the Close.
Araluen crawled forth from the crater that had opened
at her feet. The crystal horn on her forehead seemed
somewhat dimmer than before, but the blaze of her sword
was yet bright. The lesser portion of the Rotting Man was
nowhere to be seen. The greater portion cursed anew as
he saw the Aspect emerging from what he had hoped was
her grave.

The slime hardened, stretched, and transmuted itself
into yet another form, that one more heinous than the
last. It was a great twining serpent with ebony scales
and with eyes like dark pits of space that ate light-twin
vortexes of nothingness.
Free of the crater, Araluen again spoke forth ringing
words of power and touched her blade to the buckled pave-
ment. A white flame surged down the blade, continued
across the space separating her from the Rotting Man
in serpent's shape, and flared into a nova of fire. The
serpent screamed as its scales ignited and its breath
burned it from within. Still shrieking it leaped forward,
out of the fire, and still burning, it charged the Aspect.
Its teeth were like daggers, its claws swords, and its wings
a tornado.
Araluen smote at the snaking neck but missed. The
Rotting Man was upon her, biting and raking with his
claws. Araluen dropped her sword, and her hands found
the Talontyr's neck. The crystal horn on her forehead
began to blaze with light, a light similar to that which
accompanied her transformation from Daughter to As-
pect. The dark wells of the Rotting Man's eyes drank all
the light, but there was yet more to give. The light flared;
the darkness expanded. The ground shook.
The shining horn pierced the Rotting Man's side, and
all was tumult.
When the ground finally ceased its shuddering, the
celestial lights faded, the hellish dark cleared, and the
thundering detonations echoed their last, the Aspect
proved the mightier that day.
Marrec had watched the entire battle, when it wasn't
obscured by releases of energy too extreme even for one
accustomed to powers of divine magnitude.
With Marrec stood his friends Ususi and Gunggari.
300 ⚫ THE PRIESTS

--- Page 308 ---
Elowen, barely living, yet drew breath and would only
grow the stronger with the cleric's healing attention.
Of the Rotting Man, only the memory of his final
words remained, as he fled the field of battle, "I yield
only for this moment."
Araluen was much diminished from her struggle. She
stood apart from the others, gazing about the Close, which
was visible following the dispersing mist.
The Aspect said, "The Rotting Man is gone from this
place, but he is not beaten. Talona's Chosen was chastised,
but his power was not broken."
"Ash... I mean, Araluen," said Marrec, "I don't under-
stand. You defeated the Talontyr; we saw you."
The Aspect, having taken the form of a tall, lithe
woman smiled sadly. "The effort it cost me to free my
greater self from the cystborn curse was not insignificant.
Retrieving myself from the Rotting Man's influence was
an awful trial, though one which I could not have begun
without your timely assistance, kind Marrec."
The cleric's face reddened.
Araluen continued, "But I succeeded, finally. What
power remained to me was called immediately to the
fore when I faced the Rotting Man. As you saw, he carries
much of Talona's power within him. I had to exhaust my
stores just to chase him away. Had he known how much
power I expended, he might have stayed to finish me, risk-
ing his own final annihilation."
"His strength is unchanged?" Marrec glanced around,
studying the edges of the Close, making sure some new
incursion was not even then creeping up unobserved.
"The Rotting Man, too, used much of his personal
power just to control the form in which he put me. When
I burst that control, that which he expended was wasted.
While his act was pure evil, this project absorbed much
.
BRUCE R. CORDELL ⚫ 301

--- Page 309 ---
of his time and energy these last years that otherwise
might have been put to more direct use, to the dismay
of the Green Powers. Even though I was trapped and
separated from myself, my entry into the world did, in
truth, slow the Rotting Man and weaken him. Now all
his best plans are in ruin. His most powerful minions,
the blightlords, are slain; he'll have to recruit anew. His
massed forces are scattered or killed; his strength is only
a tenth of what he promised his mistress Talona, and she
punishes failure."
All remained quiet for a moment to absorb the im-
pact of the Aspect's words, as well as wonder what form
Talona's punishment might take.
Elowen said, her voice still weak from her ordeal,
"Thank you, Araluen. If the Nentyarch were here, he
would thank you, but you must accept my thanks in his
place."
Araluen bowed her head graciously.
Gunggari was silent, his face betraying no reaction.
Marrec knew his friend well enough to know that the Os-
lander showed respect through his reserve. Ususi, though
also quiet, seemed strangely intimidated in the presence
of Lurue's Aspect. Funny-she'd showed less fear when
she dumped spell after spell upon the Daughter.
Araluen sighed, stretching. "It is hardly fair, is it? I am
finally set free of the trap, but I lack the power to remain.
I so looked forward to treading the forests of this world. I
must depart whence I came." She sighed. "All of us must
soldier on, doing our part, even one such as me."
"Lest I forget," added the Aspect, smiling fondly again,
"Please give this to Hemish. Without his strength and
goodness, all would have been lost long ago. His heart-
ache at the loss of his child may be somewhat dampened
if he can talk to me now and again."
The Aspect dropped a small object into Marrec's wait-
ing hand. It appeared to be a figurine carved of crystal.
The figure was that of a tiny unicorn.

She smiled, and light streamed from her form, suf-
fusing all of them. The light was more than mere
illumination. It was... empowering. It was the power
of Lurue. Within that gleam there was hope, salvation,
and an offer of protection for the needy, forlorn, and for-
saken. Also there was laughter, the satisfaction of quests
completed, and wonder at all things. All who stood in the
light knew that each of them, no matter their strengths
and weaknesses, was worthy in the eyes of Lurue. Above
all else, there was joy.
The Aspect turned her face one last time upon Marrec,
saying "Search for the unicorn always, Marrec, and in the
pursuit, find happiness."
The cleric nodded, his face stern but his gaze watery.
The Aspect leaped upward, as lithe and bright as a
shaft of light seeking to illuminate the heavens. It passed
easily between a gap in the interwoven branches above
and was gone.
Marrec brushed away a tear as he continued to gaze
upward.
"Goodbye, Ash."

THE
RIESTS
EPILOGUE
Marrec and Ususi walked behind Elowen and
Gunggari. Gunggari played upon his dizheri,
Elowen laughing and sometimes clapping ac-
companiment. So they continued, slowly, taking
the few days required, until they drew near the
borders of Rawlinswood, to the south and west
of where Dun-Tharos still sheltered in the heart
of the forest. The journey back through the
tangled forest was mostly uneventful, though
they steered well clear of wells and other cavi-
ties that threatened a passage back into the Nar
conjuries still below. All contemplated their
touch with divinity. Indeed, all were touched.
As the days of their journey toward Yeshelmaar
passed, each noted slight changes in the other.
Gunggari was more talkative, as if the assur-
ance of the Aspect's smile had somehow given
him a measure of poise, where before simple

--- Page 312 ---
reserve had always sufficed. On the other hand, Elowen
took more time for introspection before speaking her
mind, though as ever, the elf was still quick to find a bit
of joy and wonder in the sight of a growing thing or for-
est creature. Ususi also seemed somewhat kinder in her
dealings with the others, as if some bitterness was finally
dulled. The mage was more thoughtful, and her biting re-
marks had yet to reappear.
For his part, Marrec was simply happier. He was
happier not only because his contact with Lurue was as
strong and steady as it had ever been, but also because
he felt more a whole man for the first time that he could
recall. He could accept his heritage, despite its monstrous
origin. All that was required was one last remuneration.
It was Thanial, of course, his old mentor-Thanial, who
had accidentally fallen afoul of Marrec's gaze, the kind
forest ranger, whose stone-entombed body was shattered
and its pieces strewn far and wide.
"I've never heard you whistle before, Marrec, and I've
known you long," commented Gunggari.
"The tune is rather a happy one, too," noted Ususi, her
lips trying on a smile, which was becoming a less rare
sight.
"Well, I don't know the name of the tune. I'm just
whistling because the mood struck me, that's all. Plus,
before she left, Ash gave me knowledge I didn't know that
I wanted, but now that I have it, I see that it is nothing
less than essential."
Elowen raised an eyebrow, inquisitive.
"It's Thanial. I thought him destroyed forevermore, his
fragments scattered beyond recovery, but Ash has given
me special insight. I know where every last chunk, frag-
ment, stone, and pebble of Thanial lies, across the entire
span of Faerûn. Some are scattered strangely far, but I
know even of them."
Ususi began to nod, but Elowen said, "So?"
"I have been given the gift of salvation, and Thanial's,
BRUCE R. CORDELL · 305

--- Page 313 ---
too. Once I have collected all the pieces, I can meld them
into a whole, and once whole, my old mentor can be re-
leased from his mineral bondage."
Gunggari clapped Marrec on the back.
It was true. The knowledge of each stony fragment
sparkled in his mind, divinely provided, and for all Mar-
rec knew, given directly by Lurue herself, but passed
down through her emissary, the Aspect.
It was midsummer, but a fair day without scorching
heat. Looking backward at the edge of the Rawlinswood,
as it lay lower than the higher point to which they had
ascended, they saw the white sun stretching out over the
dark cloak of the woods, the light penetrating shadows
and turning shadow and darkness to the greenery of life.
The sky was blue, but darkening swiftly as evening ap-
proached, with only a faint frosting of clouds high above,
like white paint streaked across a cerulean canvas.
Yeshelmaar lay not too far distant, less than a day's
walk away, should they choose to push themselves, but
comfortable in each other's company, they chose instead
to set camp early.
As the stars came out above, Gunggari began to play
again on his dizheri. The song was one Marrec had heard
the Oslander play before, but rarely. A salute to the stars,
which the Oslander's people believed to be the spirits of
their ancestors looking down upon them, guarding them,
or at least available for advice, should they be asked.
Elowen and Ususi were talking quietly together. When
Gunggari began his music, they finished speaking and
made their way up to where the cleric reclined on a great
rock.
Elowen said, "Ususi and I find ourselves at loose ends."
"Loose ends?"
Ususi responded, "I have the Keystone, which is what
306 THE PRIESTS

--- Page 314 ---
I've long sought, but gaining it, I have discovered that
there are other things, too, beyond accumulation of
knowledge, that are worth having."
"What's that?" wondered Marrec, frowning.
Elowen answered for Ususi, "Comradeship. Listen-
now that the Rotting Man has been flushed from Dun
Tharos, my priorities have shifted, too. For so long I have
been focused on the Talontyr, but his threat is lessened.
Like Ususi... I find that I prefer traveling with a group
of friends instead of alone."
Comprehension dawned across the cleric's face.. He
shook his head, but a great contentment filled him up,
causing him to laugh. "Then, two shall become four. We're
off in the morning. First, we shall visit Hemish, to tell
him of his little girl that grew up and give him the token
Ash wanted him to have. After that, we will search out
the fragments of my past misstep. Thanial will enjoy
meeting all of you."
Marrec stood. The three, discussing their plans for
the morrow, strode over to where the Oslander continued
to play. Gunggari's notes danced into the night sky. The
stars twinkled their approval.
