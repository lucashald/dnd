        <h3>⚠️ EXTREME DANGER ⚠️</h3>
        <p><strong>Clymph Tower is one of the most dangerous locations in the known world.</strong></p>
        <p>The tower contains dozens to hundreds of imprisoned demons held only by ancient abjurative magic. Any breach of the containment circle would unleash catastrophic destruction. Only parties of level 12+ should consider approaching, and even then with extreme caution and thorough preparation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Physical Description</h2>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>The Ruins</h3>

        <blockquote>
            Even from a distance, Clymph Tower commands fear and reverence. The ruined keep rises from the scorched earth like a monument to damnation itself. Where once proud walls stood, now only blackened stones remain, arranged in geometric patterns that hurt the mind to perceive. The entire structure glows with an ominous red heat, and deep within its depths, massive flames dance and crackle as if the very fires of the Abyss burn there still.
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Structural Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Perimeter Wall:</strong> Once a mighty fortification; now reduced to blackened rubble averaging 12 feet high</li>
            <li><strong>Central Tower:</strong> The keep rises approximately 80 feet from the ground, though only fragments remain intact</li>
            <li><strong>Material:</strong> Granite and basalt, unnaturally darkened and fused by intense heat</li>
            <li><strong>Magical Circle:</strong> Ancient abjurative runes carved into the foundation stones in an intricate pattern</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Surrounding Area</h4>

            <li><strong>Scorched Earth:</strong> A 300-foot radius of blackened, lifeless ground with no vegetation</li>
            <li><strong>Ash Fields:</strong> Fine gray ash covers everything; disturbed easily by wind or movement</li>
            <li><strong>Stone Formations:</strong> Twisted, melted stone shapes around the perimeter—remnants of failed escape attempts?</li>
            <li><strong>Creature Avoidance:</strong> No animals approach; even birds avoid the airspace above</li>
            <li><strong>Atmospheric Distortion:</strong> Heat shimmer visible year-round; air tastes of sulfur and ash</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Notable Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Main Gate:</strong> Massive iron gateway, warped and fused shut by ancient magic and heat</li>
            <li><strong>Guard Towers:</strong> Four corner towers, now reduced to jagged stubs</li>
            <li><strong>Underground Levels:</strong> Partially collapsed spiral staircase descends into darkness—likely where the gate to the Abyss opens</li>
            <li><strong>The Barrier:</strong> An invisible but palpable abjurative field surrounds the entire structure</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>The Demon Prison</h2>

    <div class="abyss-box">
        <h3>Containment Architecture</h3>

        <p>Clymph Tower is not merely a fortress—it is an elaborate magical trap designed by one of the greatest demonbinders of ancient Narfell. Understanding its structure is key to understanding why it still holds after five centuries.</p>

        <h4>The Abjurative Circle</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Encompasses the entire footprint of the tower, roughly 200 feet in diameter</li>
            <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Carved into foundation stones in a pattern of concentric circles and geometric symbols</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Written in Infernal and ancient Narfelli demonbinding script</li>
            <li><strong>Power Source:</strong> Originally powered by Clymph's own lifeblood; now sustained by the residual magical energy of the imprisoned demons</li>
            <li><strong>Function:</strong> Creates an impenetrable barrier preventing any teleportation, planar travel, or dimensional transit in or out</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Still holding strong after 500 years, but showing signs of age and stress</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Abyssal Gateway</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location:</strong> Deep underground in the tower's lowest levels</li>
            <li><strong>Type:</strong> Permanent portal to the Abyss, crafted through infernal rituals</li>
            <li><strong>Status:</strong> One-way (inbound); outbound travel is blocked by the abjurative circle</li>
            <li><strong>Manifestation:</strong> Appears as a writhing tear in reality, surrounded by flame and shadow</li>
            <li><strong>Original Purpose:</strong> Summoning point for Clymph's demonic army</li>
            <li><strong>Current State:</strong> Sealed and locked by counter-rituals Clymph performed as he realized his mistake</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Demon Population</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Number:</strong> Estimates range from "dozens" to "hundreds"—the true count is unknown</li>
            <li><strong>Types:</strong> Varied demon types, from lesser quasits to potentially a balor or similar demon lord</li>
            <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Trapped and furious; pace the containment chamber constantly</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Occasionally speak through cracks in the tower, attempting to tempt or threaten potential escapees</li>
            <li><strong>Weakness:</strong> Divided loyalties and infighting weaken them; they would turn on each other as readily as escaping</li>
            <li><strong>Concern:</strong> If one powerful demon (demon prince or lord) emerges to unite them, containment could fail</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h2>History: Clymph the Demonbinder</h2>

    <div class="history-box">
        <h3>The Narfell Empire</h3>

        <p>Approximately 500 years ago, during the later days of Narfell's power (before the empire's fall to Raumathar), a sorcerer named Clymph rose to prominence among the demon-binding elite of the imperial court.</p>

        <h4>Clymph's Ambition</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Create an independent kingdom in the Great Dale, free from imperial control</li>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> Summon and bind a demonic army to conquer the region</li>
            <li><strong>Vision:</strong> A realm where infernal and mortal powers balanced in dark harmony</li>
            <li><strong>Belief:</strong> He was clever enough to master demons where others had failed</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Grand Summoning</h4>
        <p>Clymph spent years preparing Clymph Tower, imbuing every stone with abjurative magic and inscribing countless binding runes. He believed his knowledge surpassed even the legendary demonbinders of old. He was wrong.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Ritual:</strong> Performed at the height of his power, calling for demonic servants of all types</li>
            <li><strong>The Response:</strong> More demons answered than he anticipated—far more</li>
            <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> The sheer number and power of entities answering the call overwhelmed his ability to control them</li>
            <li><strong>The Chaos:</strong> Demons began fighting each other, attacking Clymph's servants, and testing the containment</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Clymph's Final Act</h4>
        <p>Realizing his disaster, Clymph performed one final, desperate act. He sealed the gateway and modified the abjurative circle, linking it to his own life force. As he poured his power into the reinforced magic, the demons turned on him. But it was too late—the circle held.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clymph's Death:</strong> Torn apart by the demons he tried to control, his blood mixed with the stones</li>
            <li><strong>The Tower's Fate:</strong> Left behind as a prison, now powered by the rage and despair of trapped demons</li>
            <li><strong>Legacy:</strong> A warning to all demonbinders: some things cannot be controlled, only contained</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Five Centuries of Imprisonment</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stability:</strong> The magical prison has held for 500 years with remarkable stability</li>
            <li><strong>Degradation:</strong> Recent millennia have seen the magic weaken slightly; some scholars worry about eventual failure</li>
            <li><strong>Legends:</strong> Local tales speak of those foolish enough to approach the tower being driven mad by demonic whispers</li>
            <li><strong>Incidents:</strong> Occasionally the magic flares, causing nearby tremors or increased flame manifestation</li>
            <li><strong>Current Status:</strong> The prison is stable but ancient—like a dam holding back a river of hatred</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-divider"></div>

    <h2>Environmental Hazards</h2>

    <div class="tactical-box">
        <h3>Heat & Temperature</h3>

        <h4>Temperature Zones</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beyond 500 feet:</strong> Normal temperature; faint heat shimmer visible</li>
            <li><strong>300-500 feet:</strong> Noticeably warm (90-100°F); mild discomfort</li>
            <li><strong>100-300 feet:</strong> Very hot (120-150°F); Constitution save DC 12 every 10 minutes or gain exhaustion</li>
            <li><strong>0-100 feet (at ruins):</strong> Extreme heat (180-220°F); Constitution save DC 15 every 5 minutes or gain exhaustion</li>
            <li><strong>Within tower structure:</strong> Unbearable heat (250°F+); Constitution save DC 18 every round or gain exhaustion; unprotected flesh blistered</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Heat Mitigation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Magical Protection:</strong> Fire resistance, endure elements, or similar magic essential</li>
            <li><strong>Physical Gear:</strong> Heavy protective clothing offers minimal benefit (–2 to save DC)</li>
            <li><strong>Water-based Healing:</strong> Potions provide temporary relief but limited use</li>
            <li><strong>Shade/Cover:</strong> Ruins provide some shelter but not much; heat radiates from stone</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Magical Aura</h3>

        <h4>Abjurative Field</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="hazard">Planar Travel Blocked:</span> Teleportation, dimension door, and similar abilities fail within 500 feet</li>
            <li><span class="hazard">Scrying Interference:</span> Magical scrying and surveillance becomes unreliable (DC 16 check to see clearly)</li>

            <li><span class="hazard">Mental Assault:</span> Demons constantly broadcast rage and despair; Wisdom save DC 14 or suffer short-term madness</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Demonic Manifestations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Whispers:</strong> Constant infernal whispers at the edge of hearing; Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom saves to resist temptation</li>
            <li><strong>Shadows:</strong> Unnatural shadows move counter to light sources; occasional glimpses of demonic silhouettes</li>
            <li><strong>Flame Manifestations:</strong> Random bursts of fire from cracks and crevices; treat as hazardous terrain</li>
            <li><strong>Reality Distortion:</strong> Time seems slow near the tower; distances are deceptive</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Environmental Obstacles</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unstable Rubble:</strong> Crumbling walls and fallen stones; difficult terrain throughout</li>
            <li><strong>Ash Drifts:</strong> Deep ash accumulation; moving through costs extra movement</li>
            <li><strong>Toxic Air:</strong> Sulfurous fumes; Constitution save DC 11 every hour or sickened</li>
            <li><strong>Melted Stone:</strong> Sharp, jagged formations that count as difficult terrain and deal 1d6 piercing damage per 10 feet of movement</li>
            <li><strong>Subsidence Zones:</strong> Ground may collapse into deeper chambers; Dexterity save DC 13 or fall 10-30 feet</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Session 4: The Threat Emerges (Climactic)</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p><strong>Level 12+ | Duration: 6+ hours | Theme: Epic confrontation, catastrophic potential, moral choices</strong></p>

        <p>Events come to a head. Either the party discovers signs of imminent containment failure, or their actions trigger a crisis. They must either reinforce the prison or face a major demonic emergence.</p>

        <h4>Crisis Scenarios</h4>

        <h5>Scenario A: Containment Collapse Warning</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Party discovers that the abjurative circle is degrading faster than anticipated</li>
            <li>Expert analysis suggests 1-6 months before total failure</li>
            <li>A powerful demon has been systematically weakening the barrier for years</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Scenario B: Ritual Misfire</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Party or NPCs attempt to reinforce containment; ritual goes wrong</li>
            <li>Demons surge against the weakened barrier; partial breach occurs</li>
            <li>Lesser demons begin manifesting outside the tower</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Scenario C: External Threat</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Another group (cultists, wizards, or worse) arrives seeking to break the seal</li>
            <li>Combat between party and external threat occurs while demons press from within</li>
            <li>Risk of containment failure increases as fighting destabilizes the structure</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Confrontation Mechanics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiple Fronts:</strong> Party faces both external threats and demonic pressure</li>
            <li><strong>Escalating Danger:</strong> As the session progresses, the situation grows worse; more demons press against barriers</li>
            <li><strong>Moral Choices:</strong> Party must decide between self-preservation and preventing catastrophic release</li>
            <li><strong>Ritual Magic:</strong> Reinforcing the circle requires time, components, and successful skill checks; party must hold the line</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Potential Demon Encounters</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lesser Demons (CR 2-5):</strong> Quasits, imps, or dretches that partially manifest</li>
            <li><strong>Significant Demons (CR 6-8):</strong> Hezrous, vrock, or glabrezu attempting escape</li>
            <li><strong>Demon Leader (CR 9+):</strong> A major demon (balor, nalfeshnee) coordinating the breach attempt</li>
            <li><strong>The Collective:</strong> Party faces multiple demons working together as a swarm</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Resolution Options</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Successful Reinforcement:</strong> Party performs the ritual and stabilizes containment; tower remains sealed for another century</li>
            <li><strong>Pyrrhic Containment:</strong> Containment reinforced but at great cost; party or NPCs are possessed or corrupted</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Breach:</strong> Party prevents total catastrophe but some demons escape; ongoing threat to region</li>
            <li><strong>Catastrophic Failure:</strong> Containment fails despite party's efforts; demons emerge; region faces existential threat</li>
            <li><strong>Sacrifice Play:</strong> A party member or important NPC sacrifices themselves to reinforce the barrier</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Aftermath & Consequences</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>If Successful:</strong> Party is hailed as saviors; region is safe; tower becomes historical monument</li>
            <li><strong>If Failed:</strong> Campaign focus shifts to dealing with demonic invasion; region mobilizes for war</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed Results:</strong> Ongoing threat; tower requires periodic maintenance; opens door for future sessions</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Objectives</h4>

            <li>Prevent or minimize demonic escape</li>
            <li>Reinforce the abjurative circle if possible</li>
            <li>Survive and protect the region</li>
            <li>Decide the tower's role in the campaign going forward</li>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>Running Clymph Tower</h3>

        <h4>Atmosphere & Tone</h4>
        <p>Clymph Tower should feel apocalyptic and desperate:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emphasize the sense of cosmic horror—this is a wound in reality itself</li>
            <li>Describe the demonic voices as tempting, mocking, and increasingly urgent</li>
            <li>Use environmental descriptions to build dread (rising temperature, increasing vibration, growing flames)</li>
            <li>Make players feel the weight of containment—one mistake could doom the region</li>
            <li>Interplay between the terrible beauty of demonic power and the horror of its imprisonment</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pacing the Campaign Arc</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Session 1:</strong> Mystery and investigation; slowly revealing the scope of the threat</li>
            <li><strong>Session 2:</strong> Environmental horror; growing sense of wrongness and danger</li>
            <li><strong>Session 3:</strong> Exploration and puzzle-solving; understanding the mechanisms of containment</li>
            <li><strong>Session 4:</strong> Epic confrontation; the tower and its secrets tested to the limit</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Scaling by Level</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Levels 8-9:</strong> Focus on investigation and minor encounters; avoid major demon battles</li>
            <li><strong>Levels 10-11:</strong> Include dangerous exploration and significant demonic encounters; reinforce possibilities</li>
            <li><strong>Levels 12+:</strong> Full-scale confrontation with powerful demons; epic battle mechanics and ritual magic</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Demons</h4>

            <li><strong>Not Mindless:</strong> Demons are intelligent and strategic; they've had centuries to plan</li>
            <li><strong>Divided Purposes:</strong> Some want escape; others are content in the Abyss; some are insane</li>
            <li><strong>Temptation Focus:</strong> Demons try to corrupt and manipulate before fighting</li>
            <li><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> One demon (demon prince or powerful lord) likely leads; killing it causes internal chaos</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Environmental Challenges</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heat as Threat:</strong> Temperature should be a constant concern; resource management for cooling</li>
            <li><strong>Time Pressure:</strong> The longer party stays, the worse it gets; sense of urgency builds</li>
            <li><strong>Structural Decay:</strong> Tower is ancient and unstable; add random hazards and collapses</li>
            <li><strong>Magical Interference:</strong> Abjurative magic limits party options; force creative problem-solving</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Player Agency</h4>

            <li><strong>Multiple Solutions:</strong> Containment can be reinforced through different rituals and approaches</li>
            <li><strong>Sacrifice Options:</strong> Allow players to make meaningful sacrifices (companions, magical items, resources)</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Successes:</strong> Don't force a binary win/lose outcome; allow nuanced results</li>
            <li><strong>Future Hooks:</strong> Leave room for ongoing connection to the tower and its mysteries</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Reward Considerations</h4>
